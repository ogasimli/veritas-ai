      requirement: |-
        IFRIC 5, ‘Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds’, effective from 1 January 2006, explains how to treat expected reimbursements from funds set up to meet the costs of decommissioning plant (such as nuclear plant) or equipment (such as cars) or in undertaking environmental restoration or rehabilitation (such as rectifying pollution of water or restoring mined land). This interpretation applies to accounting in the financial statements of a contributor for interests arising from decommissioning funds that have both of the following features: 
        (a)  the assets are administered separately (either by being held in a separate legal entity or as segregated assets within another entity); and
        (b)  a contributor’s right to access the assets is restricted.
        
        A residual interest in a fund that extends beyond a right to reimbursement, such as a contractual right to distributions once all the decommissioning has been completed or on winding up the fund, may be an equity instrument within the scope of IFRS 9 and is not within the scope of this Interpretation.

        Determining appropriate classes of assets and liabilities for which disclosures about fair value measurements should be provided requires judgement. A class of assets and liabilities will often require greater disaggregation than the line items presented in the statement of financial position.

      requirement: |-
        An entity shall consider the level of detail necessary to satisfy the disclosure objective and how much emphasis to place on each of the various requirements.
        If the disclosures provided, applying the detailed disclosure requirements (IFRS 17p97-132), are not enough to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the effect that contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 have on the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows, an entity shall disclose additional information necessary to meet that objective.

        The objective of the disclosure requirements is for an entity to disclose information in the notes that, together with the information provided in the statement of financial position, statement(s) of financial performance and statement of cash flows, gives a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect that contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 have on the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. To achieve that objective, an entity shall disclose qualitative and quantitative information about: 
        (a) the amounts recognised in its financial statements for contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 (IFRS17p97-116); 
        (b) the significant judgements, and changes in those judgements, made when applying IFRS 17 (IFRS 17p117-120); and

        (b) geographical area (for example, country or region); or
        (c) reportable segment, as defined in IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

In accordance with paragraph 5.5.9 of IFRS 9, the determination of whether lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised is based on the increase in the risk of a default occurring since initial recognition. Information about an entity’s definitions of default that will assist users of financial statements in understanding how an entity has applied the expected credit loss requirements in IFRS 9 may include:
        (a) the qualitative and quantitative factors considered in defining default;
        (b) whether different definitions have been applied to different types of financial instruments; and

        For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts the loss allowance is recognised as a provision. An entity should disclose information about the changes in the loss allowance for financial assets separately from those for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. However, if a financial instrument includes both a loan (ie financial asset) and an undrawn commitment (ie loan commitment) component and the entity cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the loan commitment component from those on the financial asset component, the expected credit losses on the loan commitment should be recognised together with the loss allowance for the financial asset. To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, the expected credit losses should be recognised as a provision.

A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a geographical region or are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. An entity should provide information that enables users of financial statements to understand whether there are groups or portfolios of

        Activities that give rise to credit risk and the associated maximum exposure to credit risk include, but are not limited to: (a) granting loans to customers and placing deposits with other entities. In these cases, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the related financial assets. (b) entering into derivative contracts, eg foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and credit derivatives. When the resulting asset is measured at fair value, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period will equal the carrying amount. (c) granting financial guarantees. In this case, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the entity could have to pay if the guarantee is called on, which may be significantly greater than the amount recognised as a liability. (d) making a loan commitment that is irrevocable over the life of the facility or is revocable only in response to a material adverse change. If the issuer cannot settle the loan commitment net in cash or another financial instrument, the maximum credit exposure is the full amount of the commitment. This is because it is uncertain whether the amount of any undrawn portion may be drawn upon in the future. This may be significantly greater than the amount recognised as a liability.

For example, financial liabilities that an entity can be required to repay on demand (eg demand deposits) are included in the earliest time band. 
        (b) when an entity is committed to make amounts available in instalments, each instalment is allocated to the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay. For example, an undrawn loan commitment is included in the time band containing the earliest date it can be drawn down. 
        (c) for issued financial guarantee contracts the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantee could be called.

        (b) prices specified in forward agreements to purchase financial assets for cash; 
        (c) net amounts for pay-floating/receive-fixed interest rate swaps for which net cash flows are exchanged; 
        (d) contractual amounts to be exchanged in a derivative financial instrument (eg a currency swap) for which gross cash flows are exchanged; and 
        (e) gross loan commitments. 
        Such undiscounted cash flows differ from the amount included in the statement of financial position because the amount in that statement is based on discounted cash flows. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period. For example, when the amount payable varies with 
        changes in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on the level of the index at the end of the period.

        Paragraph 40(a) requires a sensitivity analysis for each type of market risk to which the entity is exposed. In accordance with paragraph B3, an entity decides how it aggregates information to display the overall picture without combining information with different characteristics about exposures to risks from significantly different economic environments. For example: 
        (a) an entity that trades financial instruments might disclose this information separately for financial instruments held for trading and those not held for trading. 
        (b) an entity would not aggregate its exposure to market risks from areas of hyperinflation with its exposure to the same market risks from areas of very low inflation.

      requirement: |-
        Paragraph 40(a) requires the sensitivity analysis to show the effect on profit or loss and equity of reasonably possible changes in the relevant risk variable (eg prevailing market interest rates, currency rates, equity prices or 
        commodity prices). For this purpose: 
        (a) entities are not required to determine what the profit or loss for the period would have been if relevant risk variables had been different. Instead, entities disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity at the end of the reporting period assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable had occurred at the end of the reporting period and had been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date. For example, if an entity has a floating rate liability at the end of the year, the entity would disclose the effect on profit or loss (ie interest expense) for the current year if interest rates

      requirement: |-
        In determining what a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable is, an entity should consider: 
        (a) the economic environments in which it operates. A reasonably possible change should not include remote or ‘worst case’ scenarios or ‘stress tests’. Moreover, if the rate of change in the underlying risk variable is stable, the entity need not alter the chosen reasonably possible change in the risk variable. For example, assume that interest rates are 5 per cent and an entity determines that a fluctuation in interest rates of ±50 basis points is reasonably possible. It would disclose the effect on 
        profit or loss and equity if interest rates were to change to 4.5 per cent or 5.5 per cent. In the next period, interest rates have increased to 5.5 per cent. The entity continues to believe that interest rates may fluctuate by ±50 basis points (ie that the rate of change in interest rates is stable). The entity would disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity if interest rates were to change to 5 per cent or 6 per cent. The entity would not be required to revise its assessment that interest rates might reasonably fluctuate by ±50 basis points, unless there is evidence that interest rates have become significantly more volatile. 
        (b) the time frame over which it is making the assessment. The sensitivity analysis shall show the effects of changes that are considered to be reasonably possible over the period until the entity will next present these disclosures, which is usually its next annual reporting period.

        Paragraph 41 permits an entity to use a sensitivity analysis that reflects interdependencies between risk variables, such as a value-at-risk methodology, if it uses this analysis to manage its exposure to financial risks. This applies even if such a methodology measures only the potential for loss and does not measure the potential for gain. Such an entity might comply with paragraph 41(a) by disclosing the type of value-at-risk model used (eg whether the model relies on Monte Carlo simulations), an explanation about how the model works and the main assumptions (eg the holding period and confidence 
        level). Entities might also disclose the historical observation period and weightings applied to observations within that period, an explanation of how options are dealt with in the calculations, and which volatilities and correlations (or, alternatively, Monte Carlo probability distribution simulations) are used.

        Other price risk arises on financial instruments because of changes in, for example, commodity prices or equity prices. To comply with paragraph 40, an entity might disclose the effect of a decrease in a specified stock market index, commodity price, or other risk variable. For example, if an entity gives residual value guarantees that are financial instruments, the entity discloses an increase or decrease in the value of the assets to which the guarantee applies.

However, the amounts disclosed (in, for example, a table) are limited to the amounts that are subject to set-off. For example, an entity may have a recognised derivative asset and a recognised derivative liability that meet the offsetting criteria in paragraph 42 of IAS 32. If the gross amount of the derivative asset is larger than the gross amount of the derivative liability, the financial asset disclosure table will include the entire amount of the derivative asset (in accordance with paragraph 13C(a)) and the entire amount of the derivative liability (in
        accordance with paragraph 13C(b)). However, while the financial liability disclosure table will include the entire amount of the derivative liability (in accordance with paragraph 13C(a)), it will only include the amount of the derivative asset (in accordance with paragraph 13C(b)) that is equal to the amount of the derivative liability.

For financial instruments, such disclosure may include: 
        (a) for financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss: 
        (i) the nature of the financial liabilities the entity has designated as at fair value through profit or loss;
        (ii) the criteria for so designating such financial liabilities on initial recognition; and
        (iii) how the entity has satisfied the conditions in IFRS 9 para 4.2.2 for such designation.l 
        (aa) for financial assets designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss: 
        (i) the nature of the financial assets the entity has designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss; and
        (ii) how the entity has satisfied the criteria in IFRS 9 para 4.1.5 for such designation.
        (c) whether regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade date or at settlement date (see IFRS 9 para 3.1.2).
        (e) how net gains or net losses on each category of financial instrument are determined (see IFRS 7.20(a)), for example, whether the net gains or net losses on items at fair value through profit or loss include interest or dividend income. 
        IAS 1 para 122 also requires entities to disclose, along with its significant accounting policies or other notes, the judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that management has made in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

      requirement: |-
        An entity shall present the disclosures required by IFRS 7 paras 42B–42H in a single note in its financial statements.
        Provide the required disclosures for all transferred financial assets that are not derecognised and for any continuing involvement in a transferred asset, existing at the reporting date, irrespective of when the related transfer transaction occurred. 
        For the purposes of applying the disclosure requirements in those paragraphs, an entity transfers all or a part of a financial asset (the transferred financial asset) only if it either:
        (a) transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of that financial asset; or
        (b) retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of that financial asset but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement.
        (a) to understand the relationship between transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and the associated liabilities; and
        (b) to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, the entity's continuing involvement in derecognised financial assets.

      requirement: |-
        The disclosures required in paragraphs 42D–42G may not be sufficient to meet the disclosure objectives in paragraph 42B. If this is the case, the entity shall disclose whatever additional information is necessary to meet the disclosure objectives. The entity shall decide, in the light of its circumstances, how much additional information it needs to provide to satisfy the information needs of users and how much emphasis it places on different aspects of the additional information. It is necessary to strike a balance between burdening financial statements with excessive detail that may not assist users of financial statements and obscuring information as a result of too much aggregation.

        For the purposes of applying the disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 paras 42E-42H, an entity has continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if, as part of the transfer, the entity retains any of the contractual rights or obligations inherent in the transferred financial asset or obtains any new contractual rights or obligations relating to the transferred financial asset. For the purposes of applying the disclosure requirements in paras 42E-42H, the following do not constitute continuing involvement: 
        (b) forward, option and other contracts to reacquire the transferred financial asset for which the contract price (or exercise price) is the fair value of the transferred financial asset; or
        (c) an arrangement whereby an entity retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of a financial asset but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more entities and the conditions in paragraph 3.2.5(a)–(c) of IFRS 9 are met.
        (a) normal representations and warranties relating to fraudulent transfer and concepts of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealings that could invalidate a transfer as a result of legal action;
    - id: "A8.6.a.14"
      reference: "IFRS7AppdxB29"
      requirement: |-
        The assessment of continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset for the purposes of the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 42E–42H is made at the level of the reporting entity. For example, if a subsidiary transfers to an unrelated third party a financial asset in which the parent of the subsidiary has continuing involvement, the subsidiary does not include the parent’s involvement in the assessment of whether it has continuing involvement in the transferred asset in its separate or individual financial statements (ie when the subsidiary is the reporting entity). However, a parent would include its
        continuing involvement (or that of another member of the group) in a financial asset transferred by its subsidiary in determining whether it has continuing involvement in the transferred asset in its consolidated financial statements (ie when the reporting entity is the group).
    - id: "A8.6.a.15"
      reference: "IFRS7AppdxB30"
      requirement: |-
        An entity does not have a continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if, as part of the transfer, it neither retains any of the contractual rights or obligations inherent in the transferred financial asset nor acquires any new contractual rights or obligations relating to the transferred financial asset. An entity does not have continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if it has neither an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial asset nor a responsibility under any circumstances to make payments in respect of the transferred financial asset in the future. The term ‘payment’ in this context does not include cash flows of the transferred financial asset that an entity collects and is required to remit to the transferee.

      requirement: |-
        When an entity transfers a financial asset, the entity may retain the right to service that financial asset for a fee that is included in, for example, a servicing contract. The entity assesses the servicing contract in accordance with the guidance in paragraphs 42C and B30 to decide whether the entity has continuing involvement as a result of the servicing contract for the purposes of the disclosure requirements. For example, a servicer will have continuing involvement in the transferred financial asset for the purposes of the disclosure requirements if the servicing fee is dependent on the amount or timing of the cash flows collected from the transferred financial asset. Similarly, a servicer has continuing involvement for the purposes of the disclosure requirements if a fixed fee would not be paid in full because of nonperformance of the transferred financial asset. In these examples, the servicer has an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial asset. This assessment is independent of whether the fee to be received is expected to compensate the entity adequately for performing the servicing.

        To meet the objectives set out in IFRS 7 para 42B(b), when an entity derecognises transferred financial assets in their entirety (see paragraph 3.2.6(a) and (c)(i) of IFRS 9) but has continuing involvement in them, disclose, as a minimum, for each type of continuing involvement at each reporting date:
        (a) the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that are recognised in the entity's statement of financial position and represent the entity's continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets, and the line items in which the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities are recognised;
        (b) the fair value of the assets and liabilities that represent the entity's continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets;
        (c) the amount that best represents the entity's maximum exposure to loss from its continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets, and information showing how the maximum exposure to loss is determined;
        (d) the undiscounted cash outflows that would or may be required to repurchase derecognised financial assets (for example, the strike price in an option agreement) or other amounts payable to the transferee in respect of the transferred assets. If the cash outflow is variable the amount disclosed should be based on the conditions that exist at each reporting date;
        (e) a maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash outflows that would or may be required to repurchase the derecognised financial assets or other amounts payable to the transferee in respect of the transferred assets, showing the remaining contractual maturities of the entity's continuing involvement;  and

This analysis distinguishes cash flows that are required to be paid (eg forward contracts), cash flows that the entity may be required to pay (eg written put options) and cash flows that the entity might choose to pay (eg purchased call options).

        (a) a description of how the entity manages the risk inherent in its continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets.
        (b) whether the entity is required to bear losses before other parties, and the ranking and amounts of losses borne by parties whose interests rank lower than the entity’s interest in the asset (ie its continuing involvement in the asset).

        (c) if the total amount of proceeds from transfer activity (that qualifies for derecognition) in a reporting period is not evenly distributed throughout the reporting period (for example, if a substantial proportion of the total amount of transfer activity takes place in the closing days of a reporting period):
        (i) when the greatest transfer activity took place within that reporting period (eg the last five days before the end of the reporting period);
        (ii) the amount (for example, related gains or losses) recognised from transfer activity in that part of the reporting period; and

The entity shall disclose if a gain or loss on derecognition arose because the fair values of the components of the previously recognised asset (ie the interest in the asset derecognised and the interest retained by the entity) were different from the fair value of the previously recognised asset as a whole. In that situation, the entity shall also disclose whether the fair value measurements included significant inputs that were not based on observable market data, as described in paragraph 27A.
