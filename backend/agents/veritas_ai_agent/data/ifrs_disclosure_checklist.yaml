        subsidiary does not include the parent’s involvement in the assessment of whether it has continuing involvement in

      description: When an entity transfers a financial asset, the entity may retain the right to service that financial asset
        for a fee that is included in, for example, a servicing contract. The entity assesses the servicing contract in accordance
        with the guidance in paragraphs 42C and B30 to decide whether the entity has continuing involvement as a result of
        the servicing contract for the purposes of the disclosure requirements. For example, a servicer will have continuing
        involvement in the transferred financial asset for the purposes of the disclosure requirements if the servicing fee
        is dependent on the amount or timing of the cash flows collected from the transferred financial asset. Similarly,
        a servicer has continuing involvement for the purposes of the disclosure requirements if a fixed fee would not be
        paid in full because of nonperformance of the transferred financial asset. In these examples, the servicer has an
        interest in the future performance of the transferred financial asset. This assessment is independent of whether the
        fee to be received is expected to compensate the entity adequately for performing the servicing.

        \ or \ncommodity prices). For this purpose: \n(a) entities are not required to determine what the profit or loss for\

        \ on profit or loss and equity at the end of the reporting period assuming that a reasonably possible change in the\
        \ relevant risk variable had occurred at the end of the reporting period and had been applied to the risk exposures\

        \ by reasonably possible amounts. \n(b) entities are not required to disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity\

        \ ‘worst case’ scenarios or ‘stress tests’. Moreover, if the rate of change in the underlying risk variable is stable,\
        \ the entity need not alter the chosen reasonably possible change in the risk variable. For example, assume that interest\
        \ rates are 5 per cent and an entity determines that a fluctuation in interest rates of ±50 basis points is reasonably\
        \ possible. It would disclose the effect on \nprofit or loss and equity if interest rates were to change to 4.5 per\
        \ cent or 5.5 per cent. In the next period, interest rates have increased to 5.5 per cent. The entity continues to\
        \ believe that interest rates may fluctuate by ±50 basis points (ie that the rate of change in interest rates is stable).\
        \ The entity would disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity if interest rates were to change to 5 per cent\
        \ or 6 per cent. The entity would not be required to revise its assessment that interest rates might reasonably fluctuate\
