          \ Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB (“IFRS Accounting Standards”) for the year ended 31 December 2024 for SRE LLC (the “Company”).\n\nThe Company was incorporated and is domiciled in the\
          \ Republic of Azerbaijan in accordance with the Azerbaijani regulations. The Company was registered as a legal entity on 21 September 2015.\n\nAs of 31 December 2024 and 2023 the Company was ultimately\
          \ controlled by Mr Fazil Fazilov.\n\nRegistered address and place of business. The Company’s registered address and principal place of business is Nasimi District, 155 XXX Avenue, AZ1010 Baku,\
          \ the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nPresentation currency. Financial statements are presented in Azerbaijani Manats (\"AZN\"), unless otherwise stated.\n\n# Operating Environment of The Company\n\
          \nThe Republic of Azerbaijan. The Republic of Azerbaijan displays certain characteristics of an emerging market. Current and future growth and stability of the economy is largely dependent upon\
          \ the effective implementation of economic, fiscal, and monetary measures undertaken by the government as well as crude oil and gas prices and the sustainability of Azerbaijani manats.\n\nIn total,\
          \ foreign exchange reserves of the country decreased by 5.1%. CBAR changed the policy rate from 10.0% to 7.25% throughout 2024, reflecting the monetary stance adequately.​ In 2024, Azerbaijan's\
          \ economy demonstrated significant growth. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 4.1%, reaching 116.3 billion manats.\n\n# Basis of preparation\n\nBasis of preparation. These financial\
          \ statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB (“IFRS Accounting Standards”) under the historical cost convention, as modified\
          \ by the initial recognition of financial instruments based on fair value. The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in each respective\
          \ Note.\n\nTransactions and balances. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the Company’s functional currency at the official exchange rate of the Central Bank of the Republic of\
          \ Azerbaijan (“CBAR”) at the end of the reporting period.\n\n# Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements in Applying Accounting Policies\n\nThe Company makes estimates and assumptions that\
          \ affect the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\n\nGoing concern. Management prepared these financial\
          \ statements on a going concern basis. In making this judgement management considered the Company’s financial position, current intentions, profitability of operations, and access to financial\
          \ resources, and analyzed the impact of the situation in the financial markets on the operations of the Company.\n\nThe Company reported losses of AZN 47,187 thousand for the year ended 31 December\
          \ 2024 (for 2023: loss of AZN 11,091 thousand). The Company’s operations are primarily financed through the contributions provided by the shareholders of the Company in the form of interest-free\
          \ loans. As of 31 December 2024, the total aggregated cash flow from these contributions equaled to AZN 197,464 thousand (As of 31 December 2023: AZN 244,464 thousand). The ability of the Company\
          \ to continue as a going concern is largely dependent on the willingness and ability of the shareholders to continue contributing funds for its operating and investing activities. Management believes\
          \ that the owners of the Company are committed to further provide funds for financing the activities of the Company.\n\nUseful lives of Investment property – see further information in the Note\

          \ 52,850 thousand (2023: nil), largely as a result of CGU’s current period losses and projected performance in future periods based on the review of the business.\n\nCGUs are allocated based on\
          \ the leased stores, as all leased stores generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from others.\n\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU was determined based on value-in-use calculations.\
          \ These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a ten-year period. Cash flows beyond the ten-year period are extrapolated using the estimated\
          \ growth rates stated below. The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business sector of the economy in which the CGU operates. Management has determined the values\
          \ assigned to each of the key assumptions used in impairment calculation as follows:\n\nSales volume - average annual growth rate over the ten-year forecast period; based on past performance and\
          \ management’s expectations of market development.\n\nSales price - average annual growth rate over the ten-year forecast period; based on current industry trends and including long-term inflation\
          \ forecasts for each territory.\n\nBudgeted gross - Based on past performance and management’s expectations for the future.\n\nLong-term growth rate - this is the weighted average growth rate\
          \ used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period. The rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports.\n\nAnnual capital expenditure - Expected cash costs in the CGUs.\
          \ CAPEX was assumed to be equal to depreciation of fixed assets which have reached 50% of net book value, and equal to inflated depreciation in terminal period.\n\nPre-tax discount rates - reflect\
          \ specific risks relating to the relevant segments and the countries in which they operate.\n\nThe similar key assumptions are used for different CGUs, as the risks are the same the CGUs are located\
          \ in the same country. Assumptions used for value-in-use calculations to which the recoverable amount is most sensitive were:\n\n|  |  |  | 2024 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|\
          \ Growth rate beyond five years |  |  | 3.3% p.a. |\n| Pre-tax discount rate |  |  | 15% p.a. |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\n6\tInvestment Property (Continued)\n\nManagement determined the budgeted revenue\
          \ growth rate based on past performance and its market expectations. The revenue from rent of stores was forecasted as historical lease rate adjusted for forecast inflation. Weighted average cost\

          \ The discount rates used reflect specific risks relating to the relevant CGUs.\n\nThe directors and management have considered and assessed reasonably possible changes for other key assumption:\n\
          \nIf the post-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections of this CGU had been 1 p.p. higher than management’s estimates, the Company would have had to recognise an impairment against\
          \ investment properties of AZN 56,971 thousand.\n\nIf the long-term growth rate in the value-in-use calculation of CGU had been 20% lower than management’s estimates at 31 December 2024 (2.7%\
          \ instead of 3.3%), the company would have had to recognise an impairment against the carrying investment properties of AZN 54,258 thousand.\n\nThe future minimum lease payments receivable under\

          \ and carrying amounts are treated through Remeasurement of borrowings from shareholders as addition in retained earnings.\n\nThe Company’s borrowings are denominated in currencies as follows:\n\

          \ has been made in these financial statements.\n\nTax contingencies. Tax, currency and customs legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan are subject to varying interpretations and changes, which\
          \ can occur frequently. Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Company may be challenged by the relevant tax authorities. As a result,\
          \ significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. According to the Tax Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect\
          \ of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain legislative circumstances reviews may cover longer periods. Management believes that its interpretation of the relevant\
          \ legislation is appropriate and the Company’s tax, currency and customs positions will be sustained. Accordingly, as of 31 December 2024 no provision for potential tax liabilities was recorded\
          \ (2023: no provision).\n\n# Financial Risk Management\n\nThe risk management function within the Company is carried out with respect to financial risks, operational risks and legal risks. Financial\
          \ risk comprises market risk (including currency risk and other price risks), credit risk and liquidity risk. The primary function of financial risk management is to establish risk limits and\
          \ to ensure that any exposure to risk stays within these limits. The operational and legal risk management functions are intended to ensure the proper functioning of internal policies and procedures\
          \ in order to minimise operational and legal risks.\n\nAlthough during 2024 global rating agencies have decreased their previous positive foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on\
          \ Azerbaijan. Management carefully assessed possible financial risks and  based on detailed analysis no significant  risk identified.\n\n# Fair Value Disclosures\n\nFair value measurements are\
          \ analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows: (i) level 1 are measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) level 2 measurements\
          \ are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and (iii) level 3\
          \ measurements are valuations not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). Management applies judgement in categorising financial instruments using the fair value hierarchy.\
          \ If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. The significance of a valuation input is assessed against the\
          \ fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\n(a) \tAssets and liabilities not measured at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed\n\nFinancial instruments of the Company mainly comprise\
          \ of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, trade payables and other taxes payable, where the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.\n\nFair values\

          \ of measurement, IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” classifies financial assets into the following categories: (a) financial assets at FVTPL; (b) debt instruments at FVOCI, (c) equity instruments\
          \ at FVOCI and (c) financial assets at AC. Financial assets at FVTPL have two sub-categories: (i) assets mandatorily measured at FVTPL, and (ii) assets designated as such upon initial recognition.\n\
          \nAs of 31 December 2024, and 31 December 2023, all of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities were carried at AC.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of financial\

        \  |\n\n# SRE LLC and its Operations\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB (“IFRS Accounting Standards”)\
        \ for the year ended 31 December 2024 for SRE LLC (the “Company”).\n\nThe Company was incorporated and is domiciled in the Republic of Azerbaijan in accordance with the Azerbaijani regulations.\
        \ The Company was registered as a legal entity on 21 September 2015.\n\nAs of 31 December 2024 and 2023 the Company was ultimately controlled by Mr Fazil Fazilov.\n\nRegistered address and place\
        \ of business. The Company’s registered address and principal place of business is Nasimi District, 155 XXX Avenue, AZ1010 Baku, the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nPresentation currency. Financial statements\
        \ are presented in Azerbaijani Manats (\"AZN\"), unless otherwise stated.\n\n# Operating Environment of The Company\n\nThe Republic of Azerbaijan. The Republic of Azerbaijan displays certain characteristics\
        \ of an emerging market. Current and future growth and stability of the economy is largely dependent upon the effective implementation of economic, fiscal, and monetary measures undertaken by the\
        \ government as well as crude oil and gas prices and the sustainability of Azerbaijani manats.\n\nIn total, foreign exchange reserves of the country decreased by 5.1%. CBAR changed the policy rate\
        \ from 10.0% to 7.25% throughout 2024, reflecting the monetary stance adequately.​ In 2024, Azerbaijan's economy demonstrated significant growth. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 4.1%,\
        \ reaching 116.3 billion manats.\n\n# Basis of preparation\n\nBasis of preparation. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as\
        \ issued by the IASB (“IFRS Accounting Standards”) under the historical cost convention, as modified by the initial recognition of financial instruments based on fair value. The material accounting\
        \ policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in each respective Note.\n\nTransactions and balances. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the Company’s\
        \ functional currency at the official exchange rate of the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan (“CBAR”) at the end of the reporting period.\n\n# Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\
        \ in Applying Accounting Policies\n\nThe Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities\
        \ within the next financial year.\n\nGoing concern. Management prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis. In making this judgement management considered the Company’s financial\
        \ position, current intentions, profitability of operations, and access to financial resources, and analyzed the impact of the situation in the financial markets on the operations of the Company.\n\
        \nThe Company reported losses of AZN 47,187 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2024 (for 2023: loss of AZN 11,091 thousand). The Company’s operations are primarily financed through the contributions\
        \ provided by the shareholders of the Company in the form of interest-free loans. As of 31 December 2024, the total aggregated cash flow from these contributions equaled to AZN 197,464 thousand\
        \ (As of 31 December 2023: AZN 244,464 thousand). The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is largely dependent on the willingness and ability of the shareholders to continue contributing\
        \ funds for its operating and investing activities. Management believes that the owners of the Company are committed to further provide funds for financing the activities of the Company.\n\nUseful\

        \ of AZN 52,850 thousand (2023: nil), largely as a result of CGU’s current period losses and projected performance in future periods based on the review of the business.\n\nCGUs are allocated based\
        \ on the leased stores, as all leased stores generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from others.\n\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU was determined based on value-in-use calculations.\
        \ These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a ten-year period. Cash flows beyond the ten-year period are extrapolated using the estimated\
        \ growth rates stated below. The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business sector of the economy in which the CGU operates. Management has determined the values\
        \ assigned to each of the key assumptions used in impairment calculation as follows:\n\nSales volume - average annual growth rate over the ten-year forecast period; based on past performance and\
        \ management’s expectations of market development.\n\nSales price - average annual growth rate over the ten-year forecast period; based on current industry trends and including long-term inflation\
        \ forecasts for each territory.\n\nBudgeted gross - Based on past performance and management’s expectations for the future.\n\nLong-term growth rate - this is the weighted average growth rate used\
        \ to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period. The rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports.\n\nAnnual capital expenditure - Expected cash costs in the CGUs. CAPEX\
        \ was assumed to be equal to depreciation of fixed assets which have reached 50% of net book value, and equal to inflated depreciation in terminal period.\n\nPre-tax discount rates - reflect specific\
        \ risks relating to the relevant segments and the countries in which they operate.\n\nThe similar key assumptions are used for different CGUs, as the risks are the same the CGUs are located in the\
        \ same country. Assumptions used for value-in-use calculations to which the recoverable amount is most sensitive were:\n\n|  |  |  | 2024 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Growth rate\
        \ beyond five years |  |  | 3.3% p.a. |\n| Pre-tax discount rate |  |  | 15% p.a. |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\n6\tInvestment Property (Continued)\n\nManagement determined the budgeted revenue growth rate\
        \ based on past performance and its market expectations. The revenue from rent of stores was forecasted as historical lease rate adjusted for forecast inflation. Weighted average cost of capital\
        \ (WACC) of the company was calculated as 14% on post-tax basis and was used as a discount rate for calculation of value in use. The tax rate in Azerbaijan is 30% of the taxable profit. The discount\
        \ rates used reflect specific risks relating to the relevant CGUs.\n\nThe directors and management have considered and assessed reasonably possible changes for other key assumption:\n\nIf the post-tax\
        \ discount rate applied to the cash flow projections of this CGU had been 1 p.p. higher than management’s estimates, the Company would have had to recognise an impairment against investment properties\
        \ of AZN 56,971 thousand.\n\nIf the long-term growth rate in the value-in-use calculation of CGU had been 20% lower than management’s estimates at 31 December 2024 (2.7% instead of 3.3%), the company\
        \ would have had to recognise an impairment against the carrying investment properties of AZN 54,258 thousand.\n\nThe future minimum lease payments receivable under operating leases of investment\

        \ Borrowings from shareholders are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently carried at AC using the effective interest method.  At initial recognition\
        \ of the borrowings fair values are calculated based on cash flows discounted at a market rate and the difference between the fair values and carrying amounts are treated through Remeasurement of\
        \ borrowings from shareholders as addition in retained earnings.\n\nThe Company’s borrowings are denominated in currencies as follows:\n\n| In thousands of Azerbaijani Manats | 31 December 2024\

        \ from contracts with customers\n\nMaterial accounting policy\n\nRevenue recognition. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When the Company\
        \ provides incentives to its tenants, the cost of the incentives is recognised over the lease term, on a straight-line basis, as a reduction of rental income. Overall decrease rent rates in Azerbaijan\
        \ caused decrease in revenue.\n\n| In thousands of Azerbaijani Manats | 2024 | 2023 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Retail property | 13,294 | 13,896 |\n| Office property | (346) | 346 |\n\

        \ |\n|  |  |  |\n\nThe Company’s revenue is primarily generated from property assets, which is operated as store by its related party Baku Supermarket LLC, contributing to 71% of the lease income\
        \ (2023: 75%).\n\n# Finance Costs\n\n| In thousands of Azerbaijani Manats |  | 2024 | 2023 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Interest expense on borrowings from shareholders |  | 15,748\
        \ | 13,285 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Total finance costs recognised in profit or loss |  | 15,748 | 13,285 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\n# Contingencies and Commitments\n\nLegal proceedings. No claims\
        \ against the Company have been received and accordingly no provision in respect of claims has been made in these financial statements.\n\nTax contingencies. Tax, currency and customs legislation\
        \ of the Republic of Azerbaijan are subject to varying interpretations and changes, which can occur frequently. Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and\
        \ activity of the Company may be challenged by the relevant tax authorities. As a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. According to the Tax Code of the Republic\
        \ of Azerbaijan fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain legislative circumstances reviews\
        \ may cover longer periods. Management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and the Company’s tax, currency and customs positions will be sustained. Accordingly,\
        \ as of 31 December 2024 no provision for potential tax liabilities was recorded (2023: no provision).\n\n# Financial Risk Management\n\nThe risk management function within the Company is carried\
        \ out with respect to financial risks, operational risks and legal risks. Financial risk comprises market risk (including currency risk and other price risks), credit risk and liquidity risk. The\
        \ primary function of financial risk management is to establish risk limits and to ensure that any exposure to risk stays within these limits. The operational and legal risk management functions\
        \ are intended to ensure the proper functioning of internal policies and procedures in order to minimise operational and legal risks.\n\nAlthough during 2024 global rating agencies have decreased\
        \ their previous positive foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on Azerbaijan. Management carefully assessed possible financial risks and  based on detailed analysis no significant\
        \  risk identified.\n\n# Fair Value Disclosures\n\nFair value measurements are analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows: (i) level 1 are measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted)\
        \ in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) level 2 measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that\
        \ is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and (iii) level 3 measurements are valuations not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). Management applies\
        \ judgement in categorising financial instruments using the fair value hierarchy. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment, that measurement is a Level\
        \ 3 measurement. The significance of a valuation input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\n(a) \tAssets and liabilities not measured at fair value but for which fair\
        \ value is disclosed\n\nFinancial instruments of the Company mainly comprise of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, trade payables and other taxes payable, where the carrying\
        \ amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.\n\nFair values analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy and the carrying value of non-financial assets measured at fair value are as\
        \ follows:\n\n|  | 31 December 2024 | 31 December 2024 | 31 December 2023 | 31 December 2023 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| In thousands of Azerbaijani Manats | Level 3 fair value | Carrying\

        \ by Measurement Category\n\nFor the purposes of measurement, IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” classifies financial assets into the following categories: (a) financial assets at FVTPL; (b) debt instruments\
        \ at FVOCI, (c) equity instruments at FVOCI and (c) financial assets at AC. Financial assets at FVTPL have two sub-categories: (i) assets mandatorily measured at FVTPL, and (ii) assets designated\
        \ as such upon initial recognition.\n\nAs of 31 December 2024, and 31 December 2023, all of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities were carried at AC.\n\nThe following table provides\
        \ a reconciliation of financial assets with these measurement categories as of 31 December 2024:\n\n| In thousands of Azerbaijani Manats | AC | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| ASSETS\

      - fsli_name: Staff costs
        claim: The Company manages investment properties with a carrying value of AZN 118,655 thousand and generates revenue of AZN 19,721 thousand with total staff costs of AZN 98 thousand.
        contradiction: It is logically implausible to operate and maintain a large portfolio of investment properties (buildings and infrastructure) with a total workforce expense that only covers the CEO's
          compensation, implying zero operational staff.
        reasoning: According to the Statement of Profit or Loss, total staff costs for 2024 were AZN 98 thousand. Note 5 (Related Parties) confirms that 'Total key management compensation' (the Director)
          is exactly AZN 98 thousand. This implies the Company has no other employees. However, Note 6 shows the Company owns buildings and infrastructure with an original cost of over AZN 200 million and
          manages retail and office properties. Operating such a large physical asset base (maintenance, rent collection, security, facility management) without any non-management employees is a business
          logic contradiction.

      - fsli_name: Revenue from contracts with customers
        claim: Revenue from 'Office property' is reported as negative AZN 346 thousand for the year 2024.
        contradiction: Revenue (rental income) from a property category cannot logically be negative under normal business operations.
        reasoning: Note 11 (Revenue) lists 'Office property' as (346) in thousands of AZN. While accounting adjustments or rebates can occur, a net negative revenue for an entire property class over a full
          fiscal year suggests either a fundamental data entry error or a logically impossible economic scenario where the landlord paid tenants more than the rent received.
        source_refs:
        - Note 11 (Revenue from contracts with customers)
      - fsli_name: Investment property
        claim: Impairment calculations are based on a 10-year cash flow projection, while future minimum lease payments show a dramatic decline and represent only ~2.3 years of current revenue.
        contradiction: The assumption of a 10-year growth-based recovery in the impairment model contradicts the disclosed contractual lease pipeline which shows the business is rapidly losing its tenant
          base.
        reasoning: Note 6 states that impairment is determined using cash flow projections covering a ten-year period with a 3.3% long-term growth rate. However, the 'Future minimum lease payments receivable'
          table in the same note shows total undiscounted receivables of only AZN 45,158 thousand. Given 2024 revenue was AZN 19,721 thousand, the existing contracts cover less than 2.3 years of activity.
          Projecting 10 years of cash flows when the contractual backlog is minimal and declining (2023 backlog was 110k vs 2024 backlog of 45k) is logically aggressive.

      - fsli_name: Finance costs
        claim: Finance costs increased from AZN 13,285 thousand to AZN 14,748 thousand despite a decrease in debt principal and a significant reduction in the discount rate.
        contradiction: The cost of debt should logically decrease when the principal is reduced by 37% and the market interest rate used for discounting drops from 12% to 4%.
        reasoning: The Company repaid AZN 47,000 thousand of shareholder borrowings (Note 10). Note 4 states the discount rate dropped from 12% to 4%. For interest-free loans carried at amortized cost,
          a lower discount rate and lower principal should lead to lower interest (unwinding) expense. Instead, the P&L shows finance costs increased from 13,285 to 14,748. This is a temporal and economic
          contradiction.

        claim: The Company repaid AZN 47,000 thousand to shareholders despite reporting a loss of AZN 47,187 thousand and stating its existence depends on shareholder support.
        contradiction: Massive cash outflows to owners are logically inconsistent with a 'going concern' warning that claims the company needs owner support to survive.
        reasoning: In the 'Going concern' section of Note 4, management states the ability to continue depends on the 'willingness and ability of the shareholders to continue contributing funds.' However,
          the Cash Flow Statement shows the Company sent AZN 47,000 thousand back to the shareholders. Repaying nearly half of the available liquidity to owners while claiming to be financially dependent
          on them is a contradictory capital management strategy.

        claim: The impairment charge for investment property is reported as AZN 52,850 thousand in the P&L but AZN 61,064 thousand in the asset movement table.
        contradiction: The narrative and primary financial statements provide a specific figure that is contradicted by the detailed asset note table.
        reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and the text in Note 6 explicitly cite an impairment of AZN 52,850 thousand. However, the movement table in Note 6 ('Detailed disclosure on movement of
          investment properties') shows an 'Impairment charge' of (61,064). This is an internal data mismatch that creates a logical inconsistency in the valuation of the company's primary asset.

      - fsli_name: Total Equity
        claim: The Statement of Changes in Equity reports a 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' of 14,748 resulting in a total column value of 100.
        contradiction: The horizontal arithmetic in the Statement of Changes in Equity (SOCE) contains a random scalar value (100) that does not follow from the component items.
        reasoning: In the SOCE for 2024, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' shows 0 for Share Capital, (14,748) for Other Reserves, and 14,748 for Accumulated Deficit. The sum of these should be
          0. However, the 'Total' column for this row shows '100'. Furthermore, summing the 2023 balance (74,922) with the 2024 movements (-47,187, -20,437, +100) results in 7,398, while the table reports
          7,298. This is a structural logical error in the equity roll-forward.

      - fsli_name: Investment property
        claim: Fair value of investment properties is exactly equal to the carrying value (at cost) despite massive impairments and a volatile market.
        contradiction: It is logically improbable for the Level 3 fair value (based on external market/income inputs) to perfectly match the depreciated/impaired cost basis of AZN 120,655 thousand.
        reasoning: Note 16 (Fair Value) states the Level 3 fair value for Investment properties is 120,655 and the carrying value is 120,655. Usually, fair value and cost (less impairment) differ unless
          the impairment was specifically calibrated to match a fair value exactly, but Note 6 says impairment was based on 'Value in Use' (an entity-specific measure), not Fair Value (a market-participant
          measure). This suggests a lack of independent valuation logic.

        claim: Related party receivables for 2023 are reported as AZN 34,967 thousand, while total receivables on the balance sheet for the same period are AZN 25,584 thousand.
        contradiction: It is logically impossible for a sub-component of an asset class (related party receivables) to exceed the total reported value of that asset class on the Statement of Financial Position.
        reasoning: In Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties), the 'Gross amount of other receivables' with 'Entities under common control' as of 31 December 2023 is stated as 34,967. However,
          the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) as of 31 December 2023 reports total 'Trade and other receivables' as only 25,584. A subset cannot be larger than the whole.

        claim: The carrying value of Buildings and Infrastructure was calculated by adding the annual depreciation charge to the opening balance.
        contradiction: Depreciation is an expense that reduces the carrying value of an asset; adding it back to increase the book value is a fundamental violation of accounting logic.
        reasoning: 'In the Note 6 movement table for 2024, the ending carrying amount for ''Building and infrastructure'' (44,864) is mathematically derived as: 101,885 (Opening) + 144 (Transfer) - 278
          (Disposals) + 70 (Acc. Dep. Disposals) + 4,107 (Depreciation charge) - 61,064 (Impairment charge) = 44,864. The arithmetic only holds if the depreciation charge of 4,107 is added. If it were correctly
          subtracted, the balance would be 36,650.'

        claim: The Company charged depreciation on 'Construction in progress' in 2023.
        contradiction: Assets under construction are logically and according to IFRS standards not subject to depreciation until they are completed and available for use.
        reasoning: The detailed disclosure table in Note 6 shows a 'Depreciation charge' of (300) in 2023 specifically allocated to the 'Construction in progress' column. Since CIP represents assets not
          yet in service, depreciating them contradicts the nature of the asset.

        claim: The interest expense (unwinding) on shareholder borrowings is approximately 14.7%, while the stated discount rate used for the calculation is 4%.
        contradiction: For interest-free loans measured at amortized cost, the finance cost (unwinding of discount) must logically equal the discount rate applied to the principal.
        reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate for shareholder borrowings is 4% for 2024. Note 10 shows an 'Interest accrual' of 14,748 on a beginning balance of 124,307 (or 77,307 after the 47,000
          repayment). An expense of 14,748 on a liability in this range represents an effective rate significantly higher than the claimed 4% market rate, suggesting the unwinding logic is inconsistent
          with the stated estimate.

        contradiction: The primary financial statement (Profit or Loss) contradicts the detailed breakdown provided in the supporting notes for the same line item and period.

          and 0 to the 'Shareholder'. This contradicts the 2023 disclosure where the cost was correctly attributed to the 'Shareholder' (13,285) and ignores the physical reality of the debt contract.

        reasoning: Note 6 explicitly lists 'Land' with a useful life of '50 [years]' in the depreciation table. While the movement table shows zero depreciation actually taken on land, the stated policy
          is a logical anomaly as land does not 'wear out' over 50 years in a way that requires cost allocation.

        reasoning: In the Statement of Profit or Loss, 'Finance income' is reported as 112. However, in the Statement of Cash Flows, under 'Adjustments for:', the line 'Finance income' shows (212). Typically,
          this adjustment reverses the non-cash portion of the income reported in the P&L. Adjusting for 100 more than was actually recorded as income is logically inconsistent and suggests either an incorrect
          adjustment or missing income in the P&L.

          contradiction.
        reasoning: The Statement of Changes in Equity for 2023 lists a 'Loss on extinguishment of shareholder borrowings' of 133,442. However, Note 10 (Reconciliation of liabilities) shows the borrowing
          balance moving from 133,424 at the start of 2023 to 124,307 at the end of 2023, primarily through remeasurement and interest. If the debt were extinguished, the closing balance in the reconciliation

        contradiction: In a table where only one category of liability is presented, the 'Total' column must logically match the values in that single category column.
        reasoning: In Note 10, for the year 2024, 'Remeasurement changes' is listed as 20,437 in the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column but as 25,437 in the 'Total' column. Consequently, the ending balance
          for 2024 is listed as 112,492 in the borrowing column and 117,492 in the total column. Since borrowings are the only item in the table, these columns should be identical; the 5,000 variance is

        contradiction: The actual depreciation charge is logically inconsistent with the minimum threshold established by the Company's own accounting policy.
        reasoning: Note 6 states the useful life for buildings and infrastructure is '3 to 40 years', which implies a minimum annual depreciation rate of 2.5% (1/40). However, the 2024 movement table shows
          a depreciation charge of 4,107 on an opening cost basis of 200,450, resulting in an effective rate of only 2.05%. This rate implies a useful life of approximately 49 years, which exceeds the maximum

        claim: The Statement of Cash Flows adjusts for AZN 309 thousand in 'Other non-cash operating costs', which exceeds the total amount of available expense categories in the P&L.
        contradiction: An adjustment for non-cash expenses cannot logically exceed the total expenses of that nature reported in the profit or loss statement.
        reasoning: The Statement of Cash Flows (2024) includes a non-cash adjustment of 309. In the Statement of Profit or Loss, 'Other expenses' is only 26, 'Professional Fees' is 41, and 'Staff costs'
          is 98. Even if all these items were entirely non-cash, their sum (165) is significantly lower than the 309 adjustment. This suggests the cash flow statement is 'reversing' expenses that do not
          exist in the reported income statement.

        claim: Service charge revenue decreased by 13% while the underlying utility costs increased by 33%.
        contradiction: It is logically inconsistent for a landlord to experience a sharp decline in service charge recovery (revenue) during a period of rapidly rising service-related costs (utilities).
        reasoning: Note 11 shows 'Service charges to tenants' fell from 7,765 in 2023 to 6,773 in 2024. Simultaneously, the Statement of Profit or Loss shows 'Utility costs' rose from 2,694 to 3,598. If
          service charges are designed to recover costs (as is standard for property management), the revenue should generally track the cost direction. A 33% increase in costs coupled with a 13% drop in
          recovery suggests a failure in the business logic of tenant recharging or data inconsistency.

        contradiction: Market-based discount rates for private entities logically include a risk premium over the central bank policy rate; using a rate nearly 50% lower than the base policy rate is economically
          implausible.
        reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate used for borrowings is 4%, based on the 'refinancing rate of Central bank'. However, the 'Operating Environment' section states the Central Bank of Azerbaijan
          (CBAR) policy rate was between 10.0% and 7.25% during 2024. A market participant would not lend to a loss-making entity at 4% when the risk-free policy rate is at least 7.25%, making the valuation

        reasoning: The Note 6 movement table for 2023 shows disposals of (3,040) and accumulated depreciation reversal of 233, implying a net book value of 2,807 was removed. The Statement of Cash Flows
          shows zero 'Proceeds from sale of investment property' and the P&L shows no 'Gain/loss on disposal'. The removal of nearly 3 million manats of assets without any economic trace is a logical gap.

          value write-downs in the same period.

        claim: Management states 'no significant risk identified' despite admitting that sovereign credit ratings for the country were downgraded in 2024.

          in risk assessment.
        reasoning: Note 14 states 'global rating agencies have decreased their... sovereign credit ratings on Azerbaijan' but concludes 'based on detailed analysis no significant risk identified.' A downgrade
          in sovereign rating increases country risk, cost of capital, and potential currency volatility, which are inherently significant risks for a company financed by shareholder loans and dependent

        reasoning: The movement table in Note 6 for the year 2023 shows a 'Depreciation charge' of (300) in the 'Construction in progress' column. By definition, construction in progress represents assets

        contradiction: The narrative claim about the discount rate used to measure the liability is logically inconsistent with the actual interest costs being accrued.
        reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate used for determination of borrowings is 4%. However, the P&L shows finance costs of 14,748 on an average borrowing balance of roughly 118,400 ((124,307+112,492)/2).
          This results in an effective interest rate of ~12.4%. If the liability was measured using a 4% market rate as claimed, the interest accrual should be approximately 4,700, not 14,748. The two figures
          represent vastly different economic realities.

        claim: A remeasurement change of 20,437 is reconciled to a total of 25,437 in the Note 10 table.
        contradiction: The reconciliation table contains a horizontal logic error where the sum of the row does not match the total provided.
        reasoning: In Note 10 (Reconciliation of liabilities), for the year 2024, the 'Non-cash changes' row for 'Remeasurement changes' shows a value of 20,437 in the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column,
          but the 'Total' column for that same row is 25,437. Since there are no other columns contributing to the total, these two numbers must be identical. A 5,000 thousand discrepancy exists within
          a single row of the same table.

        claim: The company expects future undiscounted lease payments to drop by 59% (from 110M to 45M) despite stable current revenue and a growing economy.
        contradiction: The massive projected drop in future contracted revenue contradicts the management narrative of a stable operating environment and 'significant' GDP growth of 4.1%.
        reasoning: Note 6 'Future minimum lease payments' table shows total undiscounted receivables falling from 110,374 in 2023 to 45,158 in 2024. This is a catastrophic decline in forward-looking business
          volume. However, the 'Operating Environment' section describes Azerbaijan's economy as demonstrating 'significant growth' with GDP up 4.1%. The company's internal projections of losing over half
          its future lease value is logically at odds with the positive macroeconomic narrative provided in the report.

        claim: Baku Supermarket LLC contributes 71% of lease income, yet related party revenue totals AZN 15,591 thousand.
        contradiction: The implied share of service charges paid by the related party is disproportionately higher (94.5%) than its share of rent (71%), which is logically inconsistent for standard property
          leasing.
        reasoning: 1. Note 11 reports total Rent Income of 12,948 and says Baku Supermarket (Related Party) accounts for 71% (9,193). 2. Note 5 reports total Revenue from Related Parties as 15,591. 3. Subtracting
          the Rent (9,193) leaves 6,398 of 'Service Charges' paid by the related party. 4. Total Service Charges for the year (Note 11) are 6,773. 5. This implies the related party pays 94.5% of all service
          charges (6,398 / 6,773). It is logically inconsistent for a tenant to occupy ~71% of the space (implied by rent) but pay ~94% of the utility/facility costs, as these are typically distributed

        claim: The 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' for 2024 results in a total equity impact of AZN 100 thousand.
        contradiction: A transfer between two equity components (reserves to deficit) is a zero-sum reclassification and cannot logically result in a net change to total equity.
        reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity for 2024, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' shows a decrease in Other Reserves of (14,748) and an identical increase in Accumulated Deficit
          of 14,748. Logically, the sum of this row in the 'Total' column must be 0. However, the report lists the total as 100. This implies either the math is wrong or an unexplained net creation of equity

        contradiction: A cash inflow of principal repayment must reduce the asset balance by at least that amount; a smaller reduction is logically impossible without new lending, which is not reported.
        reasoning: 1. The Statement of Cash Flows reports 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289. 2. The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Loan receivable' falling from 940 (2023) to
          768 (2024), a decrease of only 172. 3. There is no 'Loan issuance' reported in investing activities to offset the repayment. Logically, if 289 was received, the balance should have dropped to

        contradiction: The relationship between pre-tax and post-tax discount rates is mathematically and logically inconsistent with the stated tax rate.
        reasoning: 1. Note 6 states the post-tax discount rate (WACC) is 14%. 2. The same note states the tax rate in Azerbaijan is 30%. 3. Mathematically, a pre-tax rate is calculated as Post-tax / (1
          - Tax Rate). For a 14% post-tax rate, the pre-tax rate must be 20% (0.14 / 0.7). 4. The company instead reports a pre-tax discount rate of 15% in the table. This is a logical contradiction; a
          15% pre-tax rate at a 30% tax rate would imply a post-tax rate of only 10.5%.

        reasoning: 1. Note 9 and Note 12 identify the interest-bearing debt as 'Borrowings from shareholders'. 2. However, Note 5 (Related Parties) lists 'Finance cost' of 11,157 for 'Entities under common
          control' and 0 for 'Shareholders' in 2024. 3. This is logically inconsistent with 2023, where the cost (13,285) was correctly attributed to the 'Shareholder'. This suggests either the debt was

          that sums to AZN 22,007 thousand (Rent 14,242 + Service charges 7,765). There is an unexplained discrepancy of AZN 1,000 thousand between the primary statement and the supporting note.

        claim: A transfer between equity reserves resulted in a net increase in total equity.
        contradiction: Internal transfers within equity components should have a zero net impact on total equity.

          The 'Total' column for this specific row is reported as '100'. Mathematically and logically, a reclassification within equity must sum to zero in the total column. This '100' adjustment appears

        reasoning: The 'Statement of Profit or Loss' shows 'Staff costs' of AZN 98 thousand. Note 5 (Related Parties) shows 'Total key management compensation' is also AZN 98 thousand. This identity suggests
          that the company has no other employees (administrative, maintenance, security, or operations) besides the Director. Given the scale of the investment property portfolio (retail stores and offices)
          and the millions spent on utility and facility costs, having no staff other than management is logically suspect and suggests misclassification of personnel costs or an incomplete staff cost disclosure.

          2024'. However, the Statement of Financial Position reports 'Borrowings from shareholders' (the only financing liability) as AZN 112,492 thousand. The discrepancy arises because the 'Total' column
          in the Note 10 table uses a 'Remeasurement change' of 25,437, whereas the 'Borrowings' column uses 20,437. This internal table math error creates a contradiction with the primary financial statements.

          of shareholders to continue contributing funds'. However, the Statement of Cash Flows shows that in 2024, the company actually repaid AZN 47,000 thousand to shareholders (a cash outflow). It is

        reasoning: Standard IFRS practice is that Land has an infinite useful life and is not depreciated. The company's own movement table in Note 6 shows that for Land with a cost of AZN 70,207 thousand,
          the 'Accumulated depreciation' remained nil for both 2023 and 2024. Disclosing a 50-year useful life while simultaneously recording zero depreciation over time is logically inconsistent.

          Charge) - 61,064 (Impairment) = 118,655. Logically, a depreciation charge should be a deduction from the carrying amount. If it were correctly subtracted, the ending value would be 110,441. Treating

        reasoning: Total rent income is AZN 12,948 thousand (Note 11). A 71% share equals AZN 9,193 thousand. Total related party revenue is AZN 15,591 thousand (Note 5). This implies the related party
          pays AZN 6,398 thousand in service charges (15,591 - 9,193). Since total service charges for the company are only AZN 6,773 thousand (Note 11), the related party is paying 94.5% of all service
          charges. It is logically inconsistent for a tenant representing 71% of rental footprint to pay 94.5% of service costs unless they are significantly subsidizing other tenants, which contradicts

        contradiction: These three figures are mathematically and logically inconsistent with each other.
        reasoning: A post-tax rate of 14% with a 30% corporate tax rate implies a pre-tax discount rate of 20% (14% / (1 - 0.30)). The company claims to use a 15% pre-tax rate, which would imply a post-tax

        reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity (SCE) for 2023, the 'Loss on extinguishment of shareholder borrowings' is recorded as a positive amount (credit) of AZN 133,442 thousand, which increases
          total equity. By definition, a loss reduces equity. If the transaction increased equity, it was logically a gain or a contribution from owners. Labeling an equity-increasing event as a 'loss'

        claim: Finance income for 2024 is reported as AZN 112 thousand in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
        contradiction: The Statement of Cash Flows reports the non-cash adjustment for Finance income as AZN (212) thousand.
        reasoning: Typically, the finance income adjustment in the operating section of the cash flow statement (to reconcile loss to cash) should match the amount recognized in the P&L. Here, there is
          a discrepancy of AZN 100 thousand (112 vs 212). This 100k difference appears as a 'plug' in the Statement of Changes in Equity ('Transfer to accumulated deficit' total column), suggesting a fundamental
          logical break between the income statement and the cash flow reconciliation.

        claim: The recoverable amount of Investment Property (AZN 118,655k) is supported by a 10-year cash flow forecast with 3.3% long-term growth.
        contradiction: The contractual lease pipeline disclosed in the same note shows a massive 56% decline in revenue and very low total future inflows.
        reasoning: The 'Future minimum lease payments receivable' table (Note 6) shows only AZN 8,569 thousand is due in Year 1, which is a 56% drop from the current year's revenue of 19,721 thousand. Furthermore,
          the total undiscounted lease payments for all future years combined is only AZN 45,158 thousand. It is logically inconsistent to support a carrying value of AZN 118.7 million based on a long-term
          growth model when the existing legal contracts cover less than 40% of that value and indicate a sharp near-term decline in cash flows.

      - fsli_name: Utility costs
        claim: Utility costs increased from AZN 2,694k in 2023 to AZN 3,598k in 2024.
        contradiction: This 33.6% increase in input costs occurred while recovered service revenue from tenants decreased by 12.8%.
        reasoning: In commercial real estate, utility costs are typically pass-through expenses recovered via service charges. While utility costs rose by over a third, 'Service charges to tenants' (Note
          11) dropped from 7,765 to 6,773. Additionally, Note 11 cites a 'decrease in rent rates' as the cause for revenue decline. A massive spike in operational costs during a period of declining market
          rates and falling service revenue suggests a breakdown in business logic or an inability to manage core property expenses.

      - fsli_name: Finance costs
        claim: The company used a 4% discount rate for shareholder borrowings in 2024.
        contradiction: The actual finance cost recognized (AZN 15,748k) represents an effective interest rate of over 13% on the average liability.
        reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate used for interest-free shareholder loans is 4% (based on the CBAR refinancing rate). If the loans are measured at amortized cost, the finance cost in the
          P&L represents the unwinding of this discount. Finance costs of 15,748 (Note 12) on an average liability of roughly 118,400 (Note 9/10) implies an effective rate of 13.3%. Using a 4% rate for
          valuation while recognizing a 13.3% rate in the P&L is a direct logical contradiction.

        claim: The company received 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of AZN 289k during 2024.
        contradiction: The Related Party Note (Note 5) omits the 'Loan receivable' asset balance entirely.
        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows a 'Loan receivable' balance of AZN 768k (2024). The Statement of Cash Flows confirms these are related party loans by labeling the repayment
          accordingly. However, Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties), which is intended to be a comprehensive disclosure of related party exposures, fails to list this loan balance in
          its tables for 2024 or 2023.

        claim: Note 6 movement table for 2023 shows a 'Depreciation charge' of AZN 300 thousand for 'Construction in progress'.
        contradiction: Accounting logic and IFRS standards dictate that assets under construction are not depreciated as they are not yet available for use.
        reasoning: Construction in progress (CIP) represents assets still being built. Depreciation should only commence when the asset is ready for its intended use and transferred to the 'Building' category.
          Recording a depreciation charge against a CIP balance of 3,230 is a violation of basic accounting logic.

      - fsli_name: Total liabilities
        claim: Note 16 reports 2023 Total Liabilities with a carrying value of AZN 125,520 thousand.
        contradiction: This total is internally inconsistent with its components and the primary Balance Sheet.
        reasoning: The Balance Sheet for 2023 shows total liabilities of 127,520 (Borrowings 124,307 + Payables/Taxes 3,213). In the Note 16 table, Borrowings are listed at 124,307 and Trade Payables at
          4,213, which sum to 128,520. The reported 'Total' in the Note 16 table of 125,520 does not match the sum of its listed parts or the balance sheet total, indicating a failure in logical data aggregation.

      - fsli_name: Impairment of non-current assets
        statement_type: Balance Sheet / Income Statement
        discrepancy: The impairment loss for investment property in 2024 is inconsistently reported between the primary statements and the notes.
        reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and the Statement of Cash Flows both report an impairment loss of 52,850 thousand AZN for the year 2024. However, Table 10 ('Movement of Investment Properties')
          in Note 6 reports an 'Impairment charge' of 61,064 thousand AZN. Note that the roll-forward calculation for the carrying amount of investment property (175,322 + 498 - 278 + 70 - 4,107 - X = 118,655)
          only reconciles if X = 52,850, confirming that the 61,064 figure in Table 10 is a discrepancy.

        statement_type: Income Statement
        discrepancy: Total revenue for the year 2023 is inconsistent between the Statement of Profit or Loss and Note 11.
        reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss reports total revenue of 21,007 thousand AZN for 2023. However, Note 11 ('Revenue Breakdown') reports a total of 22,007 thousand AZN. The internal summation
          of the components in Note 11 (Rent income of 14,242 + Service charges of 7,765) equals 22,007, showing a 1,000 thousand AZN discrepancy with the primary income statement.

        discrepancy: Finance costs for 2024 are reported inconsistently across the financial statements.
        reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss, Statement of Cash Flows, and Statement of Changes in Equity (via the transfer to deficit) all report finance costs of 14,748 thousand AZN for 2024. However,
          Note 12 ('Finance Costs') explicitly lists the 'Total finance costs recognised in profit or loss' as 15,748 thousand AZN.

        statement_type: Income Statement / Cash Flow
        discrepancy: Finance income for 2024 differs between the Statement of Profit or Loss and the Statement of Cash Flows adjustments.
        reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss reports Finance income of 112 thousand AZN. The Statement of Cash Flows adjustment for 'Finance income' is reported as (212) thousand AZN. Mathematical
          verification of the 'Operating cash flows before working capital changes' (14,156) in the Statement of Cash Flows confirms that the 212 figure was used for the calculation, creating a conflict
          with the P&L value of 112.

        statement_type: Balance Sheet / Notes
        discrepancy: The carrying value of investment property at 31 December 2024 is inconsistent between the Balance Sheet and the Fair Value disclosures.
        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position reports 'Investment property' of 118,655 thousand AZN. However, Note 16 ('Fair Value Disclosures', Table 19) reports the 'Carrying value' for investment
          properties at cost as 120,655 thousand AZN for the same date.

        statement_type: Balance Sheet / Notes
        discrepancy: Significant discrepancies exist between the carrying amounts of liabilities reported in the Balance Sheet and those reported in the Fair Value note.
        reasoning: For 31 December 2024, the Balance Sheet reports 'Trade and other payables' of 3,203 thousand AZN and 'Total Liabilities' of 118,017 thousand AZN. Note 16 (Table 20) reports 'Trade and
          financial payables' carrying value as 3,542 thousand AZN and 'Total Liabilities' carrying value as 116,034 thousand AZN. For 31 December 2023, the Balance Sheet reports total liabilities of 127,520
          thousand AZN, while Note 16 reports 125,520 thousand AZN.

      - fsli_name: Borrowings from shareholders
        statement_type: Balance Sheet / Notes
        discrepancy: Internal inconsistency within the reconciliation of liabilities from financing activities (Note 10).
        reasoning: In Table 16 ('Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities'), the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column correctly reflects a closing balance of 112,492 thousand AZN
          for 2024, matching the Balance Sheet. However, the 'Total' column in the same table reports a closing balance of 117,492 thousand AZN and 'Remeasurement changes' of 25,437 thousand AZN (vs 20,437
          for the column), despite borrowings being the only component of the table.

        statement_type: Balance Sheet / Notes
        discrepancy: The related party receivable balance in 2023 exceeds the total trade and other receivables reported on the balance sheet.
        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position reports 'Trade and other receivables' of 25,584 thousand AZN as of 31 December 2023. However, Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties)
          reports the 'Gross amount of other receivables' from 'Entities under common control' as 34,967 thousand AZN for the same date. A subset of receivables (related party) cannot logically exceed the
          total reported balance for that line item.

        discrepancy: The total rental income and service fees reported in the Investment Property note are inconsistent with the revenue reported in the primary statements for 2024.
        reasoning: 'Note 6 (Investment Property) states: ''Rental income and service fee from investment properties was AZN 15,988 thousand.'' However, both the Statement of Profit or Loss and Note 11 (Revenue
          Breakdown) report total revenue of 19,721 thousand AZN for the year 2024. Even if ''Rental income'' (12,948) and ''Service charges'' (6,773) from Note 11 are summed, the result is 19,721, creating
          a discrepancy of 3,733 thousand AZN with the summary figure in Note 6.'

        statement_type: Statement of Changes in Equity
        discrepancy: The 'Total' column in the Statement of Changes in Equity for the 2024 transfer between reserves and accumulated deficit contains a mathematical error.
        reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' for the year 2024 shows a decrease in 'Other reserves' of 14,748 thousand AZN and an increase in 'Accumulated
          deficit' of 14,748 thousand AZN. The 'Total' column for this row is reported as 100 thousand AZN. Since this is an internal transfer between equity components, the net impact on total equity should
          be zero.

        statement_type: Balance Sheet / Cash Flow
        discrepancy: The movement in the loan receivable balance on the balance sheet does not reconcile with the cash receipts reported in the Statement of Cash Flows.
        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Loan receivable' decreasing from 940 thousand AZN in 2023 to 768 thousand AZN in 2024, a net reduction of 172 thousand AZN. However, the Statement
          of Cash Flows reports 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 thousand AZN under investing activities. In the absence of new loan disbursements, the balance should have decreased
          by 289 thousand AZN (to 651 thousand AZN) rather than 172 thousand AZN.

        discrepancy: The counterparty classification for finance costs in 2024 is inconsistent between Note 5 and Note 12.
        reasoning: Note 12 (Finance Costs) attributes the interest expense to 'borrowings from shareholders.' Similarly, Note 9 and the Balance Sheet categorize the debt as 'Borrowings from shareholders.'
          However, Note 5 (Related Party Transactions) for 2024 lists 11,157 thousand AZN of finance cost under 'Entities under common control' while showing no finance costs under the 'Shareholder' column,
          contradicting the source of the debt described elsewhere.

        discrepancy: The impairment/reversal for financial assets in 2023 differs by 2 thousand AZN between the P&L and the Cash Flow Statement.
        reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss reports a 'Reversal/ (charge) of impairment on other assets' of (9,959) thousand AZN for 2023. The Statement of Cash Flows reports an adjustment for 'Impairment/(reversal)
          of financial assets' of 9,961 thousand AZN. While the signs correctly reflect a non-cash charge adjustment, the absolute values do not match.

        discrepancy: The magnitude of the remeasurement adjustment for shareholder borrowings in 2023 is highly inconsistent between the equity statement and the liability reconciliation note.

          from financing activities') reports 'Remeasurement changes' of (22,402) thousand AZN for the same period. This represents a discrepancy of 88,638 thousand AZN.

        discrepancy: The movement table for investment property incorrectly recognizes depreciation on a non-depreciable asset category (Construction in progress).
        reasoning: In Note 6 ('Movement of Investment Properties'), the table for the year 2023 reports a 'Depreciation charge' of 300 thousand AZN specifically for the 'Construction in progress' column.
          According to standard accounting principles (IAS 40/IAS 16), assets under construction are not depreciated until they are available for use and transferred to the relevant asset category.

          + Trade payables of 4,213) equals 128,520 thousand AZN. Furthermore, the primary Balance Sheet reports total liabilities of 127,520 thousand AZN for the same date, creating a three-way conflict.

        reasoning: In Note 11 ('Revenue Breakdown'), revenue from 'Office property' for 2024 is reported as (346) thousand AZN. Revenue represents gross inflows of economic benefits and should typically
          be positive; a negative balance suggests an unexplained reversal or an error in classification, especially as the same item was a positive 346 thousand AZN in 2023.

        reasoning: Note 6 reports the 'Carrying amount at 31 December 2023' for 'Building and infrastructure' as 101,185 thousand AZN in the roll-forward section. However, the summary table immediately
          following it reports the same item as 101,885 thousand AZN. Mathematical verification (Cost 200,584 - Acc. Dep. 27,648 - Acc. Imp. 71,051) confirms 101,885 is the correct calculation, making the

          loss of 52,850 thousand AZN. However, the Movement of Investment Properties table (Table 10) in Note 6 explicitly lists an 'Impairment charge' of 61,064 thousand AZN for 2024.

          finance costs of 14,748 thousand AZN for 2024. Based on an average borrowing balance of approximately 118,400 thousand AZN (opening 124,307 and closing 112,492), the effective interest rate is
          approximately 12.5%, significantly higher than the 4% disclosed.

        reasoning: Note 10 lists an ending balance of 112,492 for 'Borrowings from shareholders' but a 'Total' column value of 117,492. The Statement of Financial Position confirms the non-current liability

        reasoning: The Balance Sheet for 2023 shows Trade and other payables (2,853) and Other taxes payable (360), totaling 3,213. Note 16 reports a carrying value of 4,213, a discrepancy of 1,000 thousand

        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Trade and other receivables' decreasing from 25,584 in 2023 to 5,232 in 2024, a difference of 20,352. The Statement of Cash Flows reports a
          cash inflow (decrease) from these receivables of 30,811, creating an unexplained discrepancy of 10,459 thousand AZN.

        discrepancy: Loan repayments received from related parties in the Statement of Cash Flows (289 thousand AZN) do not match the reduction in the 'Loan receivable' balance in the Statement of Financial
          Position (172 thousand AZN).
        reasoning: The 'Loan receivable' in the Statement of Financial Position decreased from 940 (2023) to 768 (2024), indicating a principal reduction of 172. However, the Statement of Cash Flows reports
          'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 thousand AZN in investing activities.

        discrepancy: The 'Other reserves' balance at 31 December 2024 in the Statement of Changes in Equity does not reconcile to the amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position.
        reasoning: Based on movements in the SCE, the 2024 ending balance for Other reserves should be 73,933 (Opening 109,118 - Remeasurement 20,437 - Transfer 14,748). However, both the Statement of Financial
          Position and the ending balance line in the SCE report 84,972 thousand AZN.

        discrepancy: The 'Total' column for the 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' row in 2024 incorrectly reports a value of 100 thousand AZN.
        reasoning: The row reflects a transfer of 14,748 thousand AZN from 'Other reserves' to 'Accumulated deficit'. As this is an intra-equity transfer, the net effect on the 'Total' equity column must
          be zero. The reported '100' is an arithmetic error.

        reasoning: In the Statement of Profit or Loss, the line 'Reversal/ (charge) of impairment on other assets' shows a charge (expense) of 9,959 for 2023. However, the Statement of Cash Flows uses 9,961
          for the corresponding non-cash adjustment, representing an unexplained 2 thousand AZN discrepancy.

        discrepancy: Note 11 reports a negative revenue amount of (346) thousand AZN for Office property in 2024, which is inconsistent with the nature of a revenue line item.
        reasoning: The breakdown of revenue in Note 11 shows 'Office property' as (346) thousand AZN for 2024. While the note mentions rent rate decreases, a negative revenue balance (rather than a reduction
          in growth) typically indicates an accounting error or a misclassification of a refund/correction that should be disclosed separately.

        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position and Note 6 both report a total carrying amount for Investment property of 118,655. Note 16 (Fair Value Disclosures) states a carrying value of 120,655.
          Even if construction in progress (3,584) is excluded per the note's text, the remaining balance would be 115,071, making the 120,655 figure mathematically irreconcilable with the primary statements.

        discrepancy: Note 16 contains internal mathematical errors in the 'TOTAL LIABILITIES' row for the year 2023.
        reasoning: In the 'Fair values... of assets and liabilities not measured at fair value' table in Note 16, the 2023 Level 3 fair value is calculated as 112,492 + 3,542 = 116,034 for 2024, but for
          2023 it lists 124,307 (Borrowings) and 4,213 (Payables), totaling 128,520. However, the 'TOTAL LIABILITIES' line in that table reports 127,520 (Level 3) and 125,520 (Carrying value). Neither figure

          Investment Properties' table (Table 10) in Note 6 lists the 2024 'Impairment charge' as (61,064), creating an inconsistency of 8,214 thousand AZN.

        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position (Table 0) reports Borrowings from shareholders of 112,492 for 2024. In Note 10 (Table 16), the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column correctly reconciles
          to 112,492, but the 'Total' column in the same table reports an ending balance of 117,492. This is due to an inconsistent remeasurement change (25,437 vs 20,437) recorded in the total column.

        reasoning: In Note 6 (Table 10), the 'Depreciation charge' for 2024 is listed as 4,107 thousand AZN (positive), whereas for 2023 it was correctly listed as (4,136) (negative). If this charge were
          treated as a reduction to the asset value as required by accounting standards, the 31 December 2024 carrying amount would be 110,441 instead of the reported 118,655. This indicates the reported

          Note 5 (Table 5) reports revenue from entities under common control as 15,591 thousand AZN, which would represent 120% of the lease income, making the narrative disclosure of 71% impossible.

          claim: The Company manages investment properties with a carrying value of AZN 118,655 thousand and generates revenue of AZN 19,721 thousand with total staff costs of AZN 98 thousand.
          contradiction: It is logically implausible to operate and maintain a large portfolio of investment properties (buildings and infrastructure) with a total workforce expense that only covers the
            CEO's compensation, implying zero operational staff.
          reasoning: According to the Statement of Profit or Loss, total staff costs for 2024 were AZN 98 thousand. Note 5 (Related Parties) confirms that 'Total key management compensation' (the Director)
            is exactly AZN 98 thousand. This implies the Company has no other employees. However, Note 6 shows the Company owns buildings and infrastructure with an original cost of over AZN 200 million
            and manages retail and office properties. Operating such a large physical asset base (maintenance, rent collection, security, facility management) without any non-management employees is a business
            logic contradiction.

          claim: Revenue from 'Office property' is reported as negative AZN 346 thousand for the year 2024.
          contradiction: Revenue (rental income) from a property category cannot logically be negative under normal business operations.
          reasoning: Note 11 (Revenue) lists 'Office property' as (346) in thousands of AZN. While accounting adjustments or rebates can occur, a net negative revenue for an entire property class over a
            full fiscal year suggests either a fundamental data entry error or a logically impossible economic scenario where the landlord paid tenants more than the rent received.

          claim: Impairment calculations are based on a 10-year cash flow projection, while future minimum lease payments show a dramatic decline and represent only ~2.3 years of current revenue.
          contradiction: The assumption of a 10-year growth-based recovery in the impairment model contradicts the disclosed contractual lease pipeline which shows the business is rapidly losing its tenant
            base.
          reasoning: Note 6 states that impairment is determined using cash flow projections covering a ten-year period with a 3.3% long-term growth rate. However, the 'Future minimum lease payments receivable'
            table in the same note shows total undiscounted receivables of only AZN 45,158 thousand. Given 2024 revenue was AZN 19,721 thousand, the existing contracts cover less than 2.3 years of activity.
            Projecting 10 years of cash flows when the contractual backlog is minimal and declining (2023 backlog was 110k vs 2024 backlog of 45k) is logically aggressive.

          claim: Finance costs increased from AZN 13,285 thousand to AZN 14,748 thousand despite a decrease in debt principal and a significant reduction in the discount rate.
          contradiction: The cost of debt should logically decrease when the principal is reduced by 37% and the market interest rate used for discounting drops from 12% to 4%.
          reasoning: The Company repaid AZN 47,000 thousand of shareholder borrowings (Note 10). Note 4 states the discount rate dropped from 12% to 4%. For interest-free loans carried at amortized cost,
            a lower discount rate and lower principal should lead to lower interest (unwinding) expense. Instead, the P&L shows finance costs increased from 13,285 to 14,748. This is a temporal and economic
            contradiction.

          claim: The Company repaid AZN 47,000 thousand to shareholders despite reporting a loss of AZN 47,187 thousand and stating its existence depends on shareholder support.
          contradiction: Massive cash outflows to owners are logically inconsistent with a 'going concern' warning that claims the company needs owner support to survive.
          reasoning: In the 'Going concern' section of Note 4, management states the ability to continue depends on the 'willingness and ability of the shareholders to continue contributing funds.' However,
            the Cash Flow Statement shows the Company sent AZN 47,000 thousand back to the shareholders. Repaying nearly half of the available liquidity to owners while claiming to be financially dependent
            on them is a contradictory capital management strategy.

          contradiction: The narrative and primary financial statements provide a specific figure that is contradicted by the detailed asset note table.
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and the text in Note 6 explicitly cite an impairment of AZN 52,850 thousand. However, the movement table in Note 6 ('Detailed disclosure on movement
            of investment properties') shows an 'Impairment charge' of (61,064). This is an internal data mismatch that creates a logical inconsistency in the valuation of the company's primary asset.

          claim: The Statement of Changes in Equity reports a 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' of 14,748 resulting in a total column value of 100.
          contradiction: The horizontal arithmetic in the Statement of Changes in Equity (SOCE) contains a random scalar value (100) that does not follow from the component items.
          reasoning: In the SOCE for 2024, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' shows 0 for Share Capital, (14,748) for Other Reserves, and 14,748 for Accumulated Deficit. The sum of these should be
            0. However, the 'Total' column for this row shows '100'. Furthermore, summing the 2023 balance (74,922) with the 2024 movements (-47,187, -20,437, +100) results in 7,398, while the table reports
            7,298. This is a structural logical error in the equity roll-forward.

          claim: Fair value of investment properties is exactly equal to the carrying value (at cost) despite massive impairments and a volatile market.
          contradiction: It is logically improbable for the Level 3 fair value (based on external market/income inputs) to perfectly match the depreciated/impaired cost basis of AZN 120,655 thousand.
          reasoning: Note 16 (Fair Value) states the Level 3 fair value for Investment properties is 120,655 and the carrying value is 120,655. Usually, fair value and cost (less impairment) differ unless
            the impairment was specifically calibrated to match a fair value exactly, but Note 6 says impairment was based on 'Value in Use' (an entity-specific measure), not Fair Value (a market-participant
            measure). This suggests a lack of independent valuation logic.

          reasoning: 1. The Statement of Profit or Loss shows total 'Staff costs' of 98. 2. Note 5 'Related Parties' identifies 'Total key management compensation' as 98. 3. This implies that the CEO/Director
            is the only employee, which is logically implausible for the maintenance, security, and administration of large-scale retail and office investment properties.

          reasoning: 1. Note 11 identifies 'Office property' revenue as (346) for 2024. 2. While refunds occur, a net negative balance for a full year of property rental suggests either a fundamental error

          reasoning: 'Summing the reported items: Revenue (19,721) + Impairment Reversal (10,459) - Impairment Charge (52,850) - Depreciation (4,107) - Utility costs (3,598) - Facility costs (2,011) - Staff
            costs (98) - Professional Fees (41) - Other expenses (26) equals (32,551) thousand AZN. This differs from the reported Operating profit of (30,551) thousand AZN by 2,000 thousand AZN.'

          discrepancy: The carrying value of Investment property at 31 December 2024 is reported as 118,655 thousand AZN in the Statement of Financial Position, but as 120,655 thousand AZN in Note 16.
          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position (Table 0) and the Investment Property movement table (Table 10) report a carrying amount of 118,655 thousand AZN. However, the Fair Value Disclosures
            table (Table 19) in Note 16 reports the 'Carrying value' as 120,655 thousand AZN.

          discrepancy: The Finance Costs for 2024 are reported as 14,748 thousand AZN in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Statement of Cash Flows (adjustments), but Note 12 (Finance Costs) reports the
            total as 15,748 thousand AZN.
          reasoning: 'Comparison of the Statement of Profit or Loss (Finance costs: 14,748) and the Statement of Cash Flows (Finance costs adjustment: 14,748) against Note 12/18 (Total finance costs: 15,748)
            shows a discrepancy of 1,000 thousand AZN.'

            of Investment Properties table.'
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and Statement of Cash Flows both record an impairment of 52,850 thousand AZN. However, the movement table in Note 6 lists an 'Impairment charge' of 61,064
            thousand AZN for 2024.

          discrepancy: Finance income for 2024 is reported as 112 thousand AZN in the Statement of Profit or Loss, but the adjustment in the Statement of Cash Flows is recorded as 212 thousand AZN.
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss shows Finance income of 112. The Statement of Cash Flows Adjustments section shows Finance income of (212), indicating a 100 thousand AZN mismatch.

          discrepancy: The total revenue for the year 2023 is reported as 21,007 thousand AZN in the Statement of Profit or Loss, but the breakdown in Note 11 totals 22,007 thousand AZN.
          reasoning: In Note 11, the sum of Total rent income (14,242) and Service charges (7,765) equals 22,007 thousand AZN, which contradicts the 21,007 reported in the Statement of Profit or Loss.

          discrepancy: 'The ending balance of liabilities from financing activities in Note 10 (Total column: 117,492) does not match the carrying amount of ''Borrowings from shareholders'' in the Statement
            of Financial Position (112,492).'
          reasoning: Note 10 lists an ending balance of 112,492 for 'Borrowings from shareholders' but a 'Total' column value of 117,492. The Statement of Financial Position confirms the non-current liability
            is 112,492, suggesting a 5,000 thousand AZN error in the Note's total column.

            in the Balance Sheet (3,213 thousand AZN).
          reasoning: The Balance Sheet for 2023 shows Trade and other payables (2,853) and Other taxes payable (360), totaling 3,213. Note 16 reports a carrying value of 4,213, a discrepancy of 1,000 thousand
            AZN.

          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position (Table 0) reports Borrowings from shareholders of 112,492 for 2024. In Note 10 (Table 16), the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column correctly reconciles
            to 112,492, but the 'Total' column in the same table reports an ending balance of 117,492. This is due to an inconsistent remeasurement change (25,437 vs 20,437) recorded in the total column.

          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss (Table 1) shows Finance income of 112. The Statement of Cash Flows (Table 3) uses an adjustment of (212) for finance income to arrive at its subtotal
            for 'Operating cash flows before working capital changes' (14,156), indicating a 100 thousand AZN discrepancy in reported income between the two statements.

          contradiction: The related party disclosure shows a sub-component of receivables that is significantly larger than the total reported on the balance sheet.
          reasoning: In the Statement of Financial Position, 'Trade and other receivables' for 2023 is reported as AZN 25,584 thousand. However, Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties) states
            that as of 31 December 2023, the 'Gross amount of other receivables' from 'Entities under common control' was AZN 34,967 thousand. It is logically impossible for a single category of receivables

          contradiction: The revenue figure in the Statement of Profit or Loss does not match the total in the Revenue note for the same period.
          reasoning: The 'Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income' lists 2023 revenue as AZN 21,007 thousand. However, Note 11 (Revenue from contracts with customers) provides a breakdown
            that sums to AZN 22,007 thousand (Rent 14,242 + Service charges 7,765). There is an unexplained discrepancy of AZN 1,000 thousand between the primary statement and the supporting note.

          contradiction: There is a 1-million-manat discrepancy between the finance costs in the income statement and the specific note describing those costs.
          reasoning: The 'Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income' reports 'Finance costs' of AZN 14,748 thousand for 2024. However, Note 12 (Finance Costs) explicitly states 'Total finance
            costs recognised in profit or loss' is AZN 15,748 thousand for 2024. These two figures should be identical as Note 12 is the primary disclosure for that P&L line item.

          contradiction: A subset of an asset class is reported at a higher value than the entire asset class on the balance sheet.
          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position reports Investment Property at AZN 118,655 thousand for 2024. Note 16 (Fair Value Disclosures) reports the 'Carrying value' of 'Investment properties
            at cost' as AZN 120,655 thousand. Furthermore, a footnote in Note 16 states that 'Investment properties under construction in progress were excluded from the table'. Note 6 shows construction
            in progress is AZN 3,584 thousand. If those were excluded, the Note 16 value should be even lower (AZN 115,071 thousand). Reporting a carrying value in the fair value note that is higher than
            the balance sheet value is logically inconsistent.

          claim: A transfer between equity reserves resulted in a net increase in total equity.
          contradiction: Internal transfers within equity components should have a zero net impact on total equity.
          reasoning: In the 'Statement of Changes in Equity' for 2024, the line 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' shows a debit to 'Other reserves' of (14,748) and a credit to 'Accumulated deficit' of 14,748.
            The 'Total' column for this specific row is reported as '100'. Mathematically and logically, a reclassification within equity must sum to zero in the total column. This '100' adjustment appears
            to be a forced plug that creates an inconsistency in the equity roll-forward.

          claim: The company's total staff costs for the year are exactly equal to its key management compensation.
          contradiction: This implies the company operates a AZN 125 million asset base and generates AZN 19 million in revenue with zero non-management employees.
          reasoning: The 'Statement of Profit or Loss' shows 'Staff costs' of AZN 98 thousand. Note 5 (Related Parties) shows 'Total key management compensation' is also AZN 98 thousand. This identity suggests
            that the company has no other employees (administrative, maintenance, security, or operations) besides the Director. Given the scale of the investment property portfolio (retail stores and offices)
            and the millions spent on utility and facility costs, having no staff other than management is logically suspect and suggests misclassification of personnel costs or an incomplete staff cost
            disclosure.

          claim: Revenue for 'Office property' is reported as a negative amount.
          contradiction: Revenue represents gross inflows of economic benefits; a net negative revenue for a whole asset category is logically implausible for a continuing rental operation.
          reasoning: In Note 11 (Revenue from contracts with customers), 'Office property' revenue for 2024 is listed as AZN (346) thousand. While rent incentives or refunds can reduce revenue, it is logically
            inconsistent for an entire business segment (Office property) to have negative gross revenue for a full year unless the company paid tenants to occupy the space, which contradicts the 'minimum
            lease payments receivable' mentioned in Note 6.

          contradiction: The P&L, the narrative text in Note 6, and the movement table in Note 6 report contradictory impairment amounts for the same asset.
          reasoning: The P&L reports 'Impairment of non-current assets' as AZN (52,850) thousand. The text in Note 6 confirms an impairment loss of 'AZN 52,850 thousand'. However, the movement table in
            Note 6 lists the 'Impairment charge' as AZN (61,064) thousand for the Building and infrastructure category. This is an internal contradiction of AZN 8,214 thousand regarding the magnitude of
            the impairment loss.

          claim: Discount rates used for borrowings are based on the Central Bank refinancing rate, but the rates used do not match the Central Bank rates reported.
          contradiction: The document provides two different values for the same benchmark rate (Central Bank rate).
          reasoning: In Note 4 (Critical Accounting Estimates), the company states that the 4% discount rate used for borrowings is 'based on refinancing rate of Central bank'. However, in the 'Operating
            Environment' section (Note 2), it states that the 'CBAR changed the policy rate from 10.0% to 7.25% throughout 2024'. It is logically inconsistent to claim 4% is based on the central bank rate
            while simultaneously reporting that the central bank rate is 7.25%.

          claim: The reconciliation of liabilities from financing activities (Note 10) does not tie to the Statement of Financial Position.
          contradiction: The total ending balance in the reconciliation table is AZN 5,000 thousand higher than the balance reported on the balance sheet.
          reasoning: The 'Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities' in Note 10 shows an ending balance of AZN 117,492 thousand for 'Liabilities from financing activities at 31 December
            2024'. However, the Statement of Financial Position reports 'Borrowings from shareholders' (the only financing liability) as AZN 112,492 thousand. The discrepancy arises because the 'Total'
            column in the Note 10 table uses a 'Remeasurement change' of 25,437, whereas the 'Borrowings' column uses 20,437. This internal table math error creates a contradiction with the primary financial
            statements.

          claim: The company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on shareholder contributions, yet the company made massive cash repayments to shareholders during the year.
          contradiction: The claim of financial dependency on shareholders is logically inconsistent with a massive net cash outflow to those same shareholders during a period of record losses.
          reasoning: Note 4 states the company is 'primarily financed through contributions provided by shareholders' and that its 'ability to continue as a going concern is largely dependent on the willingness...
            of shareholders to continue contributing funds'. However, the Statement of Cash Flows shows that in 2024, the company actually repaid AZN 47,000 thousand to shareholders (a cash outflow). It
            is logically inconsistent to claim the company's survival depends on receiving shareholder cash when the company is currently liquidating its cash (collected from receivables) to pay back shareholders
            despite having a net loss of AZN 47,187 thousand.

          discrepancy: The impairment loss for investment property in 2024 is inconsistently reported between the primary statements and the notes.
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and the Statement of Cash Flows both report an impairment loss of 52,850 thousand AZN for the year 2024. However, Table 10 ('Movement of Investment Properties')
            in Note 6 reports an 'Impairment charge' of 61,064 thousand AZN. Note that the roll-forward calculation for the carrying amount of investment property (175,322 + 498 - 278 + 70 - 4,107 - X =
            118,655) only reconciles if X = 52,850, confirming that the 61,064 figure in Table 10 is a discrepancy.

          discrepancy: Total revenue for the year 2023 is inconsistent between the Statement of Profit or Loss and Note 11.
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss reports total revenue of 21,007 thousand AZN for 2023. However, Note 11 ('Revenue Breakdown') reports a total of 22,007 thousand AZN. The internal summation
            of the components in Note 11 (Rent income of 14,242 + Service charges of 7,765) equals 22,007, showing a 1,000 thousand AZN discrepancy with the primary income statement.

            However, Note 12 ('Finance Costs') explicitly lists the 'Total finance costs recognised in profit or loss' as 15,748 thousand AZN.

          discrepancy: Finance income for 2024 differs between the Statement of Profit or Loss and the Statement of Cash Flows adjustments.
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss reports Finance income of 112 thousand AZN. The Statement of Cash Flows adjustment for 'Finance income' is reported as (212) thousand AZN. Mathematical
            verification of the 'Operating cash flows before working capital changes' (14,156) in the Statement of Cash Flows confirms that the 212 figure was used for the calculation, creating a conflict
            with the P&L value of 112.

          discrepancy: The carrying value of investment property at 31 December 2024 is inconsistent between the Balance Sheet and the Fair Value disclosures.
          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position reports 'Investment property' of 118,655 thousand AZN. However, Note 16 ('Fair Value Disclosures', Table 19) reports the 'Carrying value' for investment
            properties at cost as 120,655 thousand AZN for the same date.

          discrepancy: Significant discrepancies exist between the carrying amounts of liabilities reported in the Balance Sheet and those reported in the Fair Value note.
          reasoning: For 31 December 2024, the Balance Sheet reports 'Trade and other payables' of 3,203 thousand AZN and 'Total Liabilities' of 118,017 thousand AZN. Note 16 (Table 20) reports 'Trade and
            financial payables' carrying value as 3,542 thousand AZN and 'Total Liabilities' carrying value as 116,034 thousand AZN. For 31 December 2023, the Balance Sheet reports total liabilities of
            127,520 thousand AZN, while Note 16 reports 125,520 thousand AZN.

          discrepancy: Internal inconsistency within the reconciliation of liabilities from financing activities (Note 10).
          reasoning: In Table 16 ('Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities'), the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column correctly reflects a closing balance of 112,492 thousand AZN
            for 2024, matching the Balance Sheet. However, the 'Total' column in the same table reports a closing balance of 117,492 thousand AZN and 'Remeasurement changes' of 25,437 thousand AZN (vs 20,437
            for the column), despite borrowings being the only component of the table.

          claim: The Company assigns a useful life of 50 years to Land for depreciation purposes.
          contradiction: Land is a non-depreciable asset under IFRS and general business logic as it has an infinite useful life.
          reasoning: In the Material Accounting Policy section of Note 6, the table for 'Useful lives in years' explicitly lists 'Land' with a useful life of '50' years. Logically and according to accounting
            standards, land does not wear out or get used up over time; therefore, assigning it a finite life for depreciation is a semantic and logical contradiction of the asset's nature.

          claim: The company recorded a depreciation charge of AZN 300 thousand on 'Construction in progress' in 2023.
          contradiction: Assets under construction are not yet available for use and therefore cannot logically or legally be depreciated.
          reasoning: The movement table in Note 6 for the year 2023 shows a 'Depreciation charge' of (300) in the 'Construction in progress' column. By definition, construction in progress represents assets
            that are not yet complete or operational. Depreciation only begins when an asset is available for its intended use. Charging depreciation on incomplete construction is a logical impossibility
            in financial reporting.

          claim: The company's ability to continue as a going concern depends on shareholder contributions, yet it repaid AZN 47 million to those shareholders in the same year.
          contradiction: Repaying a massive amount of capital to shareholders is logically inconsistent with a stated dependency on those same shareholders for survival funds.
          reasoning: The 'Going concern' section in Note 4 states that survival is 'largely dependent on the willingness and ability of the shareholders to continue contributing funds.' However, the Statement
            of Cash Flows shows a 'Repayment of shareholder borrowing' of AZN 47,000 thousand. It is logically contradictory for a management team to claim they are dependent on receiving cash from owners
            to stay afloat while simultaneously being in a liquid enough position to return AZN 47 million of cash to those same owners.

          contradiction: This figure contradicts the total current liabilities reported on the Balance Sheet for that year.
          reasoning: In Note 16 (Fair Value Disclosures), the table for liabilities 'not measured at fair value' lists the 'Carrying value' of 'Trade and financial payables' as 4,213 for 31 December 2023.
            However, the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) shows 'Total current liabilities' for 2023 as only 3,213 (comprising Trade payables of 2,853 and Other taxes of 360). The carrying
            value in the disclosure note is exactly 1,000 thousand higher than the actual balance sheet liability.

          claim: The discount rate used for borrowings is 4%, but the actual interest expense reflects an effective rate of approximately 12.4%.
          contradiction: The narrative claim about the discount rate used to measure the liability is logically inconsistent with the actual interest costs being accrued.
          reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate used for determination of borrowings is 4%. However, the P&L shows finance costs of 14,748 on an average borrowing balance of roughly 118,400 ((124,307+112,492)/2).
            This results in an effective interest rate of ~12.4%. If the liability was measured using a 4% market rate as claimed, the interest accrual should be approximately 4,700, not 14,748. The two
            figures represent vastly different economic realities.

          contradiction: The reconciliation table contains a horizontal logic error where the sum of the row does not match the total provided.
          reasoning: In Note 10 (Reconciliation of liabilities), for the year 2024, the 'Non-cash changes' row for 'Remeasurement changes' shows a value of 20,437 in the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column,
            but the 'Total' column for that same row is 25,437. Since there are no other columns contributing to the total, these two numbers must be identical. A 5,000 thousand discrepancy exists within
            a single row of the same table.

          contradiction: The massive projected drop in future contracted revenue contradicts the management narrative of a stable operating environment and 'significant' GDP growth of 4.1%.
          reasoning: Note 6 'Future minimum lease payments' table shows total undiscounted receivables falling from 110,374 in 2023 to 45,158 in 2024. This is a catastrophic decline in forward-looking business
            volume. However, the 'Operating Environment' section describes Azerbaijan's economy as demonstrating 'significant growth' with GDP up 4.1%. The company's internal projections of losing over
            half its future lease value is logically at odds with the positive macroeconomic narrative provided in the report.

          contradiction: It is logically impossible for a sub-component of an asset class (related party receivables) to exceed the total reported value of that asset class on the Statement of Financial
            Position.
          reasoning: In Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties), the 'Gross amount of other receivables' with 'Entities under common control' as of 31 December 2023 is stated as 34,967.
            However, the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) as of 31 December 2023 reports total 'Trade and other receivables' as only 25,584. A subset cannot be larger than the whole.

          claim: The carrying value of Buildings and Infrastructure was calculated by adding the annual depreciation charge to the opening balance.
          contradiction: Depreciation is an expense that reduces the carrying value of an asset; adding it back to increase the book value is a fundamental violation of accounting logic.
          reasoning: 'In the Note 6 movement table for 2024, the ending carrying amount for ''Building and infrastructure'' (44,864) is mathematically derived as: 101,885 (Opening) + 144 (Transfer) - 278
            (Disposals) + 70 (Acc. Dep. Disposals) + 4,107 (Depreciation charge) - 61,064 (Impairment charge) = 44,864. The arithmetic only holds if the depreciation charge of 4,107 is added. If it were
            correctly subtracted, the balance would be 36,650.'

          claim: The Company charged depreciation on 'Construction in progress' in 2023.
          contradiction: Assets under construction are logically and according to IFRS standards not subject to depreciation until they are completed and available for use.
          reasoning: The detailed disclosure table in Note 6 shows a 'Depreciation charge' of (300) in 2023 specifically allocated to the 'Construction in progress' column. Since CIP represents assets not
            yet in service, depreciating them contradicts the nature of the asset.

        - fsli_name: Finance costs
          claim: The interest expense (unwinding) on shareholder borrowings is approximately 14.7%, while the stated discount rate used for the calculation is 4%.
          contradiction: For interest-free loans measured at amortized cost, the finance cost (unwinding of discount) must logically equal the discount rate applied to the principal.
          reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate for shareholder borrowings is 4% for 2024. Note 10 shows an 'Interest accrual' of 14,748 on a beginning balance of 124,307 (or 77,307 after the 47,000
            repayment). An expense of 14,748 on a liability in this range represents an effective rate significantly higher than the claimed 4% market rate, suggesting the unwinding logic is inconsistent
            with the stated estimate.

          claim: Total revenue for 2023 is reported as AZN 21,007 thousand in the P&L, but Note 11 reports it as AZN 22,007 thousand.
          contradiction: The primary financial statement (Profit or Loss) contradicts the detailed breakdown provided in the supporting notes for the same line item and period.
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income shows 2023 Revenue as 21,007. However, Note 11 (Revenue) lists 2023 components as Retail (13,896), Office (346), and Service
            charges (7,765), which sum to 22,007. This 1,000 difference is a logical mismatch between the summary and the detail.

          claim: Fair value disclosures for 2023 show liabilities of AZN 4,213 thousand, exceeding the total payables on the balance sheet of AZN 3,213 thousand.
          contradiction: The fair value disclosure note reports a higher carrying value for payables than the actual balance sheet for the same period.
          reasoning: Note 16 (Fair Value Disclosures) lists the carrying value of 'Trade and financial payables' as 4,213 for 2023. However, the Statement of Financial Position for 2023 shows 'Trade and
            other payables' (2,853) plus 'Other taxes payable' (360), totaling 3,213. The fair value table claims to report carrying values that do not exist on the face of the balance sheet.

          claim: Finance costs are attributed to 'Entities under common control' in the related party note, while the debt principal is owed to the 'Shareholder'.
          contradiction: Interest expense on a loan should logically be reported as a transaction with the lender of that loan.
          reasoning: Notes 9 and 10 identify the 112,492 liability as 'Borrowings from shareholders'. However, Note 5 (Related Parties) attributes 11,157 of 2024 'Finance cost' to 'Entities under common
            control' and 0 to the 'Shareholder'. This contradicts the 2023 disclosure where the cost was correctly attributed to the 'Shareholder' (13,285) and ignores the physical reality of the debt contract.

          claim: The accounting policy states that 'Land' has a useful life of 50 years.
          contradiction: Land is logically an asset with an indefinite life and is not subject to depreciation; assigning it a 50-year life contradicts standard accounting and physical reality.
          reasoning: Note 6 explicitly lists 'Land' with a useful life of '50 [years]' in the depreciation table. While the movement table shows zero depreciation actually taken on land, the stated policy
            is a logical anomaly as land does not 'wear out' over 50 years in a way that requires cost allocation.

            - Repayments 47,000 + Interest 14,748 + Remeasurement 20,437) results in 112,492 thousand AZN. Furthermore, the 'Remeasurement changes' line for 2024 shows 20,437 in the borrowings column but

            deficit'. These inter-equity transfers should net to zero in the 'Total' column, but the table reports 100 thousand AZN.

          reasoning: 'In the ''Movement of Investment Properties'' table (Note 6) for 2024, the carrying amount is calculated as: Opening (175,322) + Additions (498) - Disposals NBV (208) + Depreciation
            (4,107) - Impairment (61,064) = 118,655. To reach the reported total of 118,655, the depreciation charge of 4,107 had to be added, whereas depreciation is a non-cash expense that should reduce

          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Trade and other receivables' decreasing from 25,584 in 2023 to 5,232 in 2024, a difference of 20,352. The Statement of Cash Flows reports
            a cash inflow (decrease) from these receivables of 30,811, creating an unexplained discrepancy of 10,459 thousand AZN.

          reasoning: The 'Loan receivable' in the Statement of Financial Position decreased from 940 (2023) to 768 (2024), indicating a principal reduction of 172. However, the Statement of Cash Flows reports
            'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 thousand AZN in investing activities.

          discrepancy: The 'Total' column for the 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' row in 2024 incorrectly reports a value of 100 thousand AZN.
          reasoning: The row reflects a transfer of 14,748 thousand AZN from 'Other reserves' to 'Accumulated deficit'. As this is an intra-equity transfer, the net effect on the 'Total' equity column must
            be zero. The reported '100' is an arithmetic error.

          discrepancy: The impairment charge on other assets for 2023 is reported as 9,959 thousand AZN in the Statement of Profit or Loss, but is adjusted as 9,961 thousand AZN in the Statement of Cash
            Flows.
          reasoning: In the Statement of Profit or Loss, the line 'Reversal/ (charge) of impairment on other assets' shows a charge (expense) of 9,959 for 2023. However, the Statement of Cash Flows uses
            9,961 for the corresponding non-cash adjustment, representing an unexplained 2 thousand AZN discrepancy.

          discrepancy: Note 11 reports a negative revenue amount of (346) thousand AZN for Office property in 2024, which is inconsistent with the nature of a revenue line item.
          reasoning: The breakdown of revenue in Note 11 shows 'Office property' as (346) thousand AZN for 2024. While the note mentions rent rate decreases, a negative revenue balance (rather than a reduction
            in growth) typically indicates an accounting error or a misclassification of a refund/correction that should be disclosed separately.

          discrepancy: The carrying value of Investment properties at cost in Note 16 (120,655 thousand AZN) for 2024 does not reconcile with the Statement of Financial Position (118,655 thousand AZN).
          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position and Note 6 both report a total carrying amount for Investment property of 118,655. Note 16 (Fair Value Disclosures) states a carrying value of 120,655.
            Even if construction in progress (3,584) is excluded per the note's text, the remaining balance would be 115,071, making the 120,655 figure mathematically irreconcilable with the primary statements.

          statement_type: Notes
          discrepancy: Note 16 contains internal mathematical errors in the 'TOTAL LIABILITIES' row for the year 2023.
          reasoning: In the 'Fair values... of assets and liabilities not measured at fair value' table in Note 16, the 2023 Level 3 fair value is calculated as 112,492 + 3,542 = 116,034 for 2024, but for
            2023 it lists 124,307 (Borrowings) and 4,213 (Payables), totaling 128,520. However, the 'TOTAL LIABILITIES' line in that table reports 127,520 (Level 3) and 125,520 (Carrying value). Neither
            figure matches the sum of the components provided.

          discrepancy: The related party receivable balance in 2023 exceeds the total trade and other receivables reported on the balance sheet.
          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position reports 'Trade and other receivables' of 25,584 thousand AZN as of 31 December 2023. However, Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties)
            reports the 'Gross amount of other receivables' from 'Entities under common control' as 34,967 thousand AZN for the same date. A subset of receivables (related party) cannot logically exceed

          discrepancy: The total rental income and service fees reported in the Investment Property note are inconsistent with the revenue reported in the primary statements for 2024.
          reasoning: 'Note 6 (Investment Property) states: ''Rental income and service fee from investment properties was AZN 15,988 thousand.'' However, both the Statement of Profit or Loss and Note 11
            (Revenue Breakdown) report total revenue of 19,721 thousand AZN for the year 2024. Even if ''Rental income'' (12,948) and ''Service charges'' (6,773) from Note 11 are summed, the result is 19,721,

          statement_type: Statement of Changes in Equity
          discrepancy: The 'Total' column in the Statement of Changes in Equity for the 2024 transfer between reserves and accumulated deficit contains a mathematical error.
          reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' for the year 2024 shows a decrease in 'Other reserves' of 14,748 thousand AZN and an increase in 'Accumulated
            deficit' of 14,748 thousand AZN. The 'Total' column for this row is reported as 100 thousand AZN. Since this is an internal transfer between equity components, the net impact on total equity

          discrepancy: The movement in the loan receivable balance on the balance sheet does not reconcile with the cash receipts reported in the Statement of Cash Flows.
          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Loan receivable' decreasing from 940 thousand AZN in 2023 to 768 thousand AZN in 2024, a net reduction of 172 thousand AZN. However, the Statement
            of Cash Flows reports 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 thousand AZN under investing activities. In the absence of new loan disbursements, the balance should have decreased
            by 289 thousand AZN (to 651 thousand AZN) rather than 172 thousand AZN.

          discrepancy: The counterparty classification for finance costs in 2024 is inconsistent between Note 5 and Note 12.
          reasoning: Note 12 (Finance Costs) attributes the interest expense to 'borrowings from shareholders.' Similarly, Note 9 and the Balance Sheet categorize the debt as 'Borrowings from shareholders.'
            However, Note 5 (Related Party Transactions) for 2024 lists 11,157 thousand AZN of finance cost under 'Entities under common control' while showing no finance costs under the 'Shareholder' column,
            contradicting the source of the debt described elsewhere.

          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss reports a 'Reversal/ (charge) of impairment on other assets' of (9,959) thousand AZN for 2023. The Statement of Cash Flows reports an adjustment for
            'Impairment/(reversal) of financial assets' of 9,961 thousand AZN. While the signs correctly reflect a non-cash charge adjustment, the absolute values do not match.

        - fsli_name: Revenue from contracts with customers
          claim: Baku Supermarket LLC contributes 71% of lease income, yet related party revenue totals AZN 15,591 thousand.
          contradiction: The implied share of service charges paid by the related party is disproportionately higher (94.5%) than its share of rent (71%), which is logically inconsistent for standard property
            leasing.
          reasoning: 1. Note 11 reports total Rent Income of 12,948 and says Baku Supermarket (Related Party) accounts for 71% (9,193). 2. Note 5 reports total Revenue from Related Parties as 15,591. 3.
            Subtracting the Rent (9,193) leaves 6,398 of 'Service Charges' paid by the related party. 4. Total Service Charges for the year (Note 11) are 6,773. 5. This implies the related party pays 94.5%
            of all service charges (6,398 / 6,773). It is logically inconsistent for a tenant to occupy ~71% of the space (implied by rent) but pay ~94% of the utility/facility costs, as these are typically
            distributed pro-rata by floor space.

          claim: The 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' for 2024 results in a total equity impact of AZN 100 thousand.
          contradiction: A transfer between two equity components (reserves to deficit) is a zero-sum reclassification and cannot logically result in a net change to total equity.
          reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity for 2024, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' shows a decrease in Other Reserves of (14,748) and an identical increase in Accumulated Deficit
            of 14,748. Logically, the sum of this row in the 'Total' column must be 0. However, the report lists the total as 100. This implies either the math is wrong or an unexplained net creation of
            equity occurred during a simple reclassification.

          claim: The Company received AZN 289 thousand in loan repayments, but the loan receivable balance decreased by only AZN 172 thousand.
          contradiction: A cash inflow of principal repayment must reduce the asset balance by at least that amount; a smaller reduction is logically impossible without new lending, which is not reported.
          reasoning: 1. The Statement of Cash Flows reports 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289. 2. The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Loan receivable' falling from 940 (2023)
            to 768 (2024), a decrease of only 172. 3. There is no 'Loan issuance' reported in investing activities to offset the repayment. Logically, if 289 was received, the balance should have dropped
            to 651 (940 - 289), not 768.

          claim: The company used a 14% post-tax WACC which corresponds to a 15% pre-tax discount rate in an environment with 30% tax.
          contradiction: The relationship between pre-tax and post-tax discount rates is mathematically and logically inconsistent with the stated tax rate.
          reasoning: 1. Note 6 states the post-tax discount rate (WACC) is 14%. 2. The same note states the tax rate in Azerbaijan is 30%. 3. Mathematically, a pre-tax rate is calculated as Post-tax / (1
            - Tax Rate). For a 14% post-tax rate, the pre-tax rate must be 20% (0.14 / 0.7). 4. The company instead reports a pre-tax discount rate of 15% in the table. This is a logical contradiction;
            a 15% pre-tax rate at a 30% tax rate would imply a post-tax rate of only 10.5%.

          claim: Finance costs for 2024 are attributed to 'Entities under common control' in Note 5, while the debt is held by 'Shareholders' in Note 9.
          contradiction: The narrative attribution of the expense in the related party disclosure contradicts the legal counterparty of the liability and the interest expense description in other notes.
          reasoning: 1. Note 9 and Note 12 identify the interest-bearing debt as 'Borrowings from shareholders'. 2. However, Note 5 (Related Parties) lists 'Finance cost' of 11,157 for 'Entities under common
            control' and 0 for 'Shareholders' in 2024. 3. This is logically inconsistent with 2023, where the cost (13,285) was correctly attributed to the 'Shareholder'. This suggests either the debt was
            transferred without disclosure or the expense is being attributed to the wrong entity type in the notes.

            other receivables' from entities under common control alone is 34,967 thousand AZN, which exceeds the total line item.

          reasoning: Note 10 (Table 16) calculates the 2023 ending balance of borrowings by applying a remeasurement change of (22,402). The Statement of Changes in Equity (Table 2) lists the remeasurement
            for the same period as (111,040), representing a major discrepancy in the value of the equity adjustment.

          discrepancy: The loan repayments received in the Statement of Cash Flows (289) do not align with the net change in the Loan receivable balance on the Balance Sheet (172).
          reasoning: The 'Loan receivable' on the Balance Sheet (Table 0) decreased from 940 in 2023 to 768 in 2024, a net reduction of 172 thousand AZN. However, the Statement of Cash Flows (Table 3) under

          discrepancy: The 2024 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' row and the 'Total' column balance contain mathematical errors.
          reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity (Table 2), the 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' row for 2024 lists (14,748) in other reserves and 14,748 in accumulated deficit, but reports '100'
            in the Total column instead of 0. Furthermore, summing the 'Total' column from the 2023 closing balance (74,922 - 47,187 - 20,437 + 100) results in 7,398, yet the table reports 7,298 at the

          reasoning: The Income Statement (Table 1) reports a charge for impairment on other assets of (9,959) for 2023. The Statement of Cash Flows (Table 3) uses an adjustment of 9,961 to reverse this
            non-cash item, creating a minor inconsistency of 2 thousand AZN.

          claim: Note 6 states Land has a useful life of 50 years.
          contradiction: This claim is contradicted by the movement table for Investment Property in Note 6 and standard accounting logic for land.
          reasoning: Standard IFRS practice is that Land has an infinite useful life and is not depreciated. The company's own movement table in Note 6 shows that for Land with a cost of AZN 70,207 thousand,
            the 'Accumulated depreciation' remained nil for both 2023 and 2024. Disclosing a 50-year useful life while simultaneously recording zero depreciation over time is logically inconsistent.

          claim: The 'Depreciation charge' of AZN 4,107 thousand is reported as a movement in the carrying amount for 2024.
          contradiction: The movement table math only works if the depreciation charge is added to the asset's value, which is logically impossible.
          reasoning: 'In the Note 6 movement table for 2024, the calculation of the ending carrying amount is: 175,322 (Opening) + 498 (Additions) - 278 (Disposals) + 70 (Acc Dep of Disposals) + 4,107 (Depreciation
            Charge) - 61,064 (Impairment) = 118,655. Logically, a depreciation charge should be a deduction from the carrying amount. If it were correctly subtracted, the ending value would be 110,441.
            Treating a depreciation expense as a value-increasing event is logically and accounting-wise contradictory.'

          claim: The related party Baku Supermarket LLC contributes 71% of lease income, while total related party revenue is AZN 15,591 thousand.
          contradiction: This implies a logically implausible allocation of service charges where the related party pays nearly all fees despite occupying a smaller portion of the space.
          reasoning: Total rent income is AZN 12,948 thousand (Note 11). A 71% share equals AZN 9,193 thousand. Total related party revenue is AZN 15,591 thousand (Note 5). This implies the related party
            pays AZN 6,398 thousand in service charges (15,591 - 9,193). Since total service charges for the company are only AZN 6,773 thousand (Note 11), the related party is paying 94.5% of all service
            charges. It is logically inconsistent for a tenant representing 71% of rental footprint to pay 94.5% of service costs unless they are significantly subsidizing other tenants, which contradicts
            the 'independent' nature of CGUs claimed in Note 6.

          claim: The recoverable amount of Investment Property was calculated using a 15% pre-tax discount rate and a 14% post-tax WACC, with a 30% tax rate.
          contradiction: These three figures are mathematically and logically inconsistent with each other.
          reasoning: A post-tax rate of 14% with a 30% corporate tax rate implies a pre-tax discount rate of 20% (14% / (1 - 0.30)). The company claims to use a 15% pre-tax rate, which would imply a post-tax
            rate of only 10.5%. Using 15% (pre-tax) and 14% (post-tax) simultaneously for a 30% tax environment is a logical impossibility.

          contradiction: The narrative label 'loss' contradicts the actual financial impact shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
          reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity (SCE) for 2023, the 'Loss on extinguishment of shareholder borrowings' is recorded as a positive amount (credit) of AZN 133,442 thousand, which
            increases total equity. By definition, a loss reduces equity. If the transaction increased equity, it was logically a gain or a contribution from owners. Labeling an equity-increasing event
            as a 'loss' is a narrative-to-data contradiction.

          contradiction: This qualitative assessment contradicts the narrative regarding the deteriorating sovereign credit environment.

            'Entities under common control' (related party banks). Given the sovereign downgrade and the company's own financial distress (Note 4), claiming 'good' credit quality for cash held entirely
            within a related-party structure in a downgraded jurisdiction is a narrative contradiction.

          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position for 2023 reports 'Trade and other payables' of AZN 2,853 thousand and 'Other taxes payable' of AZN 360 thousand, totaling AZN 3,213 thousand. Note
            16 (Fair Value Disclosures), however, lists the carrying value for this item as AZN 4,213 thousand. There is no explanation for the additional AZN 1,000 thousand of liabilities included in the

          contradiction: The amount of the remeasurement adjustment for the same debt instrument is inconsistent between the liability roll-forward and the equity statement.
          reasoning: In Note 10 (Reconciliation of liabilities from financing activities), the 'Remeasurement changes' for 2023 are reported as a reduction of AZN 22,402 thousand. However, in the Statement
            of Changes in Equity (SCE) for 2023, the 'Remeasurement of borrowings from shareholders' is reported as a reduction of AZN 111,040 thousand. It is logically inconsistent for the same debt adjustment
            to result in such widely different impacts (a difference of AZN 88.6 million) across two different disclosures.

          claim: The Company reported finance income of AZN 112 thousand in the Profit or Loss statement, but adjusted for AZN 212 thousand in the Statement of Cash Flows.
          contradiction: The non-cash adjustment in the operating cash flow section should logically match the income recognized in the profit or loss statement to neutralize its effect.
          reasoning: In the Statement of Profit or Loss, 'Finance income' is reported as 112. However, in the Statement of Cash Flows, under 'Adjustments for:', the line 'Finance income' shows (212). Typically,
            this adjustment reverses the non-cash portion of the income reported in the P&L. Adjusting for 100 more than was actually recorded as income is logically inconsistent and suggests either an
            incorrect adjustment or missing income in the P&L.

          claim: The Statement of Changes in Equity reports a 'Loss on extinguishment of shareholder borrowings' of AZN 133,442 thousand in 2023, while Note 10 shows the liability was not extinguished.
          contradiction: Extinguishment implies the legal discharge of a debt; reporting an extinguishment loss while simultaneously showing the debt principal persisting on the balance sheet is a logical
            contradiction.
          reasoning: The Statement of Changes in Equity for 2023 lists a 'Loss on extinguishment of shareholder borrowings' of 133,442. However, Note 10 (Reconciliation of liabilities) shows the borrowing
            balance moving from 133,424 at the start of 2023 to 124,307 at the end of 2023, primarily through remeasurement and interest. If the debt were extinguished, the closing balance in the reconciliation
            should be zero or a new instrument should be shown.

          claim: Note 10 contains internal discrepancies where the total column does not equal the sum of its parts for the year 2024.
          contradiction: In a table where only one category of liability is presented, the 'Total' column must logically match the values in that single category column.
          reasoning: In Note 10, for the year 2024, 'Remeasurement changes' is listed as 20,437 in the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column but as 25,437 in the 'Total' column. Consequently, the ending
            balance for 2024 is listed as 112,492 in the borrowing column and 117,492 in the total column. Since borrowings are the only item in the table, these columns should be identical; the 5,000 variance
            is an internal logical failure.

          claim: The Company depreciates 'Buildings and infrastructure' at an effective rate of approximately 2%, while its stated policy requires a minimum of 2.5%.
          contradiction: The actual depreciation charge is logically inconsistent with the minimum threshold established by the Company's own accounting policy.
          reasoning: Note 6 states the useful life for buildings and infrastructure is '3 to 40 years', which implies a minimum annual depreciation rate of 2.5% (1/40). However, the 2024 movement table
            shows a depreciation charge of 4,107 on an opening cost basis of 200,450, resulting in an effective rate of only 2.05%. This rate implies a useful life of approximately 49 years, which exceeds
            the maximum life allowed by the stated policy.

          claim: The Statement of Cash Flows adjusts for AZN 309 thousand in 'Other non-cash operating costs', which exceeds the total amount of available expense categories in the P&L.
          contradiction: An adjustment for non-cash expenses cannot logically exceed the total expenses of that nature reported in the profit or loss statement.
          reasoning: The Statement of Cash Flows (2024) includes a non-cash adjustment of 309. In the Statement of Profit or Loss, 'Other expenses' is only 26, 'Professional Fees' is 41, and 'Staff costs'
            is 98. Even if all these items were entirely non-cash, their sum (165) is significantly lower than the 309 adjustment. This suggests the cash flow statement is 'reversing' expenses that do not
            exist in the reported income statement.

          claim: Service charge revenue decreased by 13% while the underlying utility costs increased by 33%.
          contradiction: It is logically inconsistent for a landlord to experience a sharp decline in service charge recovery (revenue) during a period of rapidly rising service-related costs (utilities).
          reasoning: Note 11 shows 'Service charges to tenants' fell from 7,765 in 2023 to 6,773 in 2024. Simultaneously, the Statement of Profit or Loss shows 'Utility costs' rose from 2,694 to 3,598.
            If service charges are designed to recover costs (as is standard for property management), the revenue should generally track the cost direction. A 33% increase in costs coupled with a 13% drop
            in recovery suggests a failure in the business logic of tenant recharging or data inconsistency.

          contradiction: Market-based discount rates for private entities logically include a risk premium over the central bank policy rate; using a rate nearly 50% lower than the base policy rate is economically
            implausible.
          reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate used for borrowings is 4%, based on the 'refinancing rate of Central bank'. However, the 'Operating Environment' section states the Central Bank of Azerbaijan
            (CBAR) policy rate was between 10.0% and 7.25% during 2024. A market participant would not lend to a loss-making entity at 4% when the risk-free policy rate is at least 7.25%, making the valuation
            logic for the liability fundamentally flawed.

          claim: Note 6 reports significant asset disposals in 2023 with a net book value of AZN 2,807 thousand, but no cash proceeds or P&L impact are recorded.
          contradiction: Disposing of a material physical asset (AZN 2.8 million book value) should logically result in either a cash inflow, a gain/loss in the P&L, or an explanation for a zero-value transfer.
          reasoning: The Note 6 movement table for 2023 shows disposals of (3,040) and accumulated depreciation reversal of 233, implying a net book value of 2,807 was removed. The Statement of Cash Flows
            shows zero 'Proceeds from sale of investment property' and the P&L shows no 'Gain/loss on disposal'. The removal of nearly 3 million manats of assets without any economic trace is a logical
            gap.

          claim: Management claims the Azerbaijan economy expanded by 4.1% in 2024, yet the Company reported a collapse in rent rates and a massive property impairment.
          contradiction: A narrative of 'significant growth' and 'stability' in the national economy is logically at odds with a real estate business reporting severe market-driven rent declines and asset
            value write-downs in the same period.
          reasoning: The 'Operating Environment' note highlights 'significant growth' and a 4.1% GDP expansion for Azerbaijan in 2024. In contrast, Note 11 cites an 'Overall decrease rent rates' as the
            reason for lower revenue, and Note 6 records a massive impairment of 52,850 based on poor projected performance. Retail property values and rents are typically pro-cyclical; the company's performance
            and market outlook directly contradict the claimed macro-economic prosperity.

          claim: Management states 'no significant risk identified' despite admitting that sovereign credit ratings for the country were downgraded in 2024.
          contradiction: A sovereign rating downgrade by global agencies is a significant financial risk indicator; claiming no risk was identified while acknowledging the downgrade is a logical contradiction
            in risk assessment.
          reasoning: Note 14 states 'global rating agencies have decreased their... sovereign credit ratings on Azerbaijan' but concludes 'based on detailed analysis no significant risk identified.' A downgrade
            in sovereign rating increases country risk, cost of capital, and potential currency volatility, which are inherently significant risks for a company financed by shareholder loans and dependent
            on local property markets.

            infrastructure' is listed as 101,185 thousand AZN. In the second instance (re-confirming the balances), it is listed as 101,885 thousand AZN. The latter figure (101,885) is the one that mathematically
            reconciles with the total carrying amount of 175,322 thousand AZN when added to Land (70,207) and CIP (3,230).

            Note 5 (Table 5) reports revenue from entities under common control as 15,591 thousand AZN, which would represent 120% of the lease income, making the narrative disclosure of 71% impossible.

            assets, reports the carrying value as 120,655 thousand AZN, a discrepancy of 2,000 thousand AZN.

        reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and Statement of Cash Flows both record an impairment of 52,850 thousand AZN. However, the movement table in Note 6 lists an 'Impairment charge' of 61,064
          thousand AZN for 2024.

        reasoning: In Note 11, the sum of Total rent income (14,242) and Service charges (7,765) equals 22,007 thousand AZN, which contradicts the 21,007 reported in the Statement of Profit or Loss.

        reasoning: Note 10 lists an ending balance of 112,492 for 'Borrowings from shareholders' but a 'Total' column value of 117,492. The Statement of Financial Position confirms the non-current liability
          is 112,492, suggesting a 5,000 thousand AZN error in the Note's total column.

          in the Balance Sheet (3,213 thousand AZN).
        reasoning: The Balance Sheet for 2023 shows Trade and other payables (2,853) and Other taxes payable (360), totaling 3,213. Note 16 reports a carrying value of 4,213, a discrepancy of 1,000 thousand

        reasoning: In Note 5 (Related Party Outstanding Balances at 31 December 2023), the gross amount of other receivables from entities under common control is reported as 34,967. However, the Statement
          of Financial Position for the same period shows only 25,584 for total Trade and other receivables and 940 for Loan receivable, aggregating to 26,524, which is significantly less than the related

        reasoning: 'In the ''Movement of Investment Properties'' table (Note 6) for 2024, the carrying amount is calculated as: Opening (175,322) + Additions (498) - Disposals NBV (208) + Depreciation (4,107)
          - Impairment (61,064) = 118,655. To reach the reported total of 118,655, the depreciation charge of 4,107 had to be added, whereas depreciation is a non-cash expense that should reduce the carrying

        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Trade and other receivables' decreasing from 25,584 in 2023 to 5,232 in 2024, a difference of 20,352. The Statement of Cash Flows reports a
          cash inflow (decrease) from these receivables of 30,811, creating an unexplained discrepancy of 10,459 thousand AZN.

        reasoning: The 'Loan receivable' in the Statement of Financial Position decreased from 940 (2023) to 768 (2024), indicating a principal reduction of 172. However, the Statement of Cash Flows reports
          'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 thousand AZN in investing activities.

        discrepancy: The 'Total' column for the 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' row in 2024 incorrectly reports a value of 100 thousand AZN.
        reasoning: The row reflects a transfer of 14,748 thousand AZN from 'Other reserves' to 'Accumulated deficit'. As this is an intra-equity transfer, the net effect on the 'Total' equity column must
          be zero. The reported '100' is an arithmetic error.

        reasoning: In the Statement of Profit or Loss, the line 'Reversal/ (charge) of impairment on other assets' shows a charge (expense) of 9,959 for 2023. However, the Statement of Cash Flows uses 9,961
          for the corresponding non-cash adjustment, representing an unexplained 2 thousand AZN discrepancy.

        discrepancy: Note 11 reports a negative revenue amount of (346) thousand AZN for Office property in 2024, which is inconsistent with the nature of a revenue line item.
        reasoning: The breakdown of revenue in Note 11 shows 'Office property' as (346) thousand AZN for 2024. While the note mentions rent rate decreases, a negative revenue balance (rather than a reduction
          in growth) typically indicates an accounting error or a misclassification of a refund/correction that should be disclosed separately.

        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position and Note 6 both report a total carrying amount for Investment property of 118,655. Note 16 (Fair Value Disclosures) states a carrying value of 120,655.
          Even if construction in progress (3,584) is excluded per the note's text, the remaining balance would be 115,071, making the 120,655 figure mathematically irreconcilable with the primary statements.

        discrepancy: Note 16 contains internal mathematical errors in the 'TOTAL LIABILITIES' row for the year 2023.
        reasoning: In the 'Fair values... of assets and liabilities not measured at fair value' table in Note 16, the 2023 Level 3 fair value is calculated as 112,492 + 3,542 = 116,034 for 2024, but for
          2023 it lists 124,307 (Borrowings) and 4,213 (Payables), totaling 128,520. However, the 'TOTAL LIABILITIES' line in that table reports 127,520 (Level 3) and 125,520 (Carrying value). Neither figure

        reasoning: In the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income (Table 1) and the Statement of Cash Flows (Table 3), the finance cost for 2024 is 14,748. However, Note 12 (Table 18)
          reports the 'Total finance costs recognised in profit or loss' for 2024 as 15,748. This represents a discrepancy of 1,000 thousand AZN.

          Investment Properties' table (Table 10) in Note 6 lists the 2024 'Impairment charge' as (61,064), creating an inconsistency of 8,214 thousand AZN.

        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position (Table 0) reports Borrowings from shareholders of 112,492 for 2024. In Note 10 (Table 16), the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column correctly reconciles
          to 112,492, but the 'Total' column in the same table reports an ending balance of 117,492. This is due to an inconsistent remeasurement change (25,437 vs 20,437) recorded in the total column.

        discrepancy: The movement table for Investment Properties contains two inconsistent rows for the carrying amount at 31 December 2023.
        reasoning: In Note 6 (Table 10), the 'Carrying amount at 31 December 2023' is listed twice within the same table. The first instance reports a carrying amount of 101,185 thousand AZN for Buildings
          and infrastructure, while the second instance reports 101,885 thousand AZN, creating an internal inconsistency of 700 thousand AZN.

        discrepancy: The 2024 depreciation charge in the Investment Property movement table is applied as a positive value to arrive at the ending balance, which is accounting and mathematically incorrect.
        reasoning: In Note 6 (Table 10), the 'Depreciation charge' for 2024 is listed as 4,107 thousand AZN (positive), whereas for 2023 it was correctly listed as (4,136) (negative). If this charge were
          treated as a reduction to the asset value as required by accounting standards, the 31 December 2024 carrying amount would be 110,441 instead of the reported 118,655. This indicates the reported
          total was achieved by incorrectly adding the depreciation back.

        reasoning: Note 12 (Table 18) reports 'Total finance costs recognised in profit or loss' of 15,748 thousand AZN for 2024. However, Note 10 (Table 16) reports the 'Interest accrual' for the same
          period as 14,748 thousand AZN. This represents a discrepancy of 1,000 thousand AZN between the two supporting notes.

          Note 5 (Table 5) reports revenue from entities under common control as 15,591 thousand AZN, which would represent 120% of the lease income, making the narrative disclosure of 71% impossible.

          in Note 6 reports an 'Impairment charge' of 61,064 thousand AZN. Note that the roll-forward calculation for the carrying amount of investment property (175,322 + 498 - 278 + 70 - 4,107 - X = 118,655)
          only reconciles if X = 52,850, confirming that the 61,064 figure in Table 10 is a discrepancy.

          of the components in Note 11 (Rent income of 14,242 + Service charges of 7,765) equals 22,007, showing a 1,000 thousand AZN discrepancy with the primary income statement.

          Note 12 ('Finance Costs') explicitly lists the 'Total finance costs recognised in profit or loss' as 15,748 thousand AZN.

        discrepancy: Finance income for 2024 differs between the Statement of Profit or Loss and the Statement of Cash Flows adjustments.
        reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss reports Finance income of 112 thousand AZN. The Statement of Cash Flows adjustment for 'Finance income' is reported as (212) thousand AZN. Mathematical
          verification of the 'Operating cash flows before working capital changes' (14,156) in the Statement of Cash Flows confirms that the 212 figure was used for the calculation, creating a conflict

        reasoning: For 31 December 2024, the Balance Sheet reports 'Trade and other payables' of 3,203 thousand AZN and 'Total Liabilities' of 118,017 thousand AZN. Note 16 (Table 20) reports 'Trade and
          financial payables' carrying value as 3,542 thousand AZN and 'Total Liabilities' carrying value as 116,034 thousand AZN. For 31 December 2023, the Balance Sheet reports total liabilities of 127,520
          thousand AZN, while Note 16 reports 125,520 thousand AZN.

        discrepancy: Internal inconsistency within the reconciliation of liabilities from financing activities (Note 10).

          for 2024, matching the Balance Sheet. However, the 'Total' column in the same table reports a closing balance of 117,492 thousand AZN and 'Remeasurement changes' of 25,437 thousand AZN (vs 20,437
          for the column), despite borrowings being the only component of the table.

          reports the 'Gross amount of other receivables' from 'Entities under common control' as 34,967 thousand AZN for the same date. A subset of receivables (related party) cannot logically exceed the

          Breakdown) report total revenue of 19,721 thousand AZN for the year 2024. Even if ''Rental income'' (12,948) and ''Service charges'' (6,773) from Note 11 are summed, the result is 19,721, creating

        discrepancy: The 'Total' column in the Statement of Changes in Equity for the 2024 transfer between reserves and accumulated deficit contains a mathematical error.
        reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' for the year 2024 shows a decrease in 'Other reserves' of 14,748 thousand AZN and an increase in 'Accumulated
          deficit' of 14,748 thousand AZN. The 'Total' column for this row is reported as 100 thousand AZN. Since this is an internal transfer between equity components, the net impact on total equity should

          of Cash Flows reports 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 thousand AZN under investing activities. In the absence of new loan disbursements, the balance should have decreased
          by 289 thousand AZN (to 651 thousand AZN) rather than 172 thousand AZN.

            IFRS (and as implied by the Company's own policy which only lists Building and Land), assets under construction are typically not depreciated until they are complete and available for use.

          discrepancy: Note 6 contains an internal inconsistency regarding the carrying amount of 'Building and infrastructure' at 31 December 2023.
          reasoning: The 'Movement of Investment Properties' table (Table 10) provides two separate rows for the 'Carrying amount at 31 December 2023'. In the first instance, the value for 'Building and
            infrastructure' is listed as 101,185 thousand AZN. In the second instance (re-confirming the balances), it is listed as 101,885 thousand AZN. The latter figure (101,885) is the one that mathematically
            reconciles with the total carrying amount of 175,322 thousand AZN when added to Land (70,207) and CIP (3,230).

            finance costs of 14,748 thousand AZN for 2024. Based on an average borrowing balance of approximately 118,400 thousand AZN (opening 124,307 and closing 112,492), the effective interest rate
            is approximately 12.5%, significantly higher than the 4% disclosed.

          claim: Note 6 states 'Rental income and service fee from investment properties was AZN 15,988 thousand.'
          contradiction: This figure is significantly lower than the total revenue reported in Note 11 and the Statement of Profit or Loss.
          reasoning: Note 11 provides a detailed breakdown of revenue totaling AZN 19,721 thousand (Rent 12,948 + Service Charges 6,773). Note 6, which discusses the underlying assets (Investment Property)
            for this entire revenue stream, reports a total of only 15,988 thousand for the same period. There is an unexplained discrepancy of AZN 3,733 thousand (~19% of total revenue) between the revenue

          claim: Finance income for 2024 is reported as AZN 112 thousand in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
          contradiction: The Statement of Cash Flows reports the non-cash adjustment for Finance income as AZN (212) thousand.
          reasoning: Typically, the finance income adjustment in the operating section of the cash flow statement (to reconcile loss to cash) should match the amount recognized in the P&L. Here, there is
            a discrepancy of AZN 100 thousand (112 vs 212). This 100k difference appears as a 'plug' in the Statement of Changes in Equity ('Transfer to accumulated deficit' total column), suggesting a
            fundamental logical break between the income statement and the cash flow reconciliation.

          contradiction: The contractual lease pipeline disclosed in the same note shows a massive 56% decline in revenue and very low total future inflows.
          reasoning: The 'Future minimum lease payments receivable' table (Note 6) shows only AZN 8,569 thousand is due in Year 1, which is a 56% drop from the current year's revenue of 19,721 thousand.
            Furthermore, the total undiscounted lease payments for all future years combined is only AZN 45,158 thousand. It is logically inconsistent to support a carrying value of AZN 118.7 million based
            on a long-term growth model when the existing legal contracts cover less than 40% of that value and indicate a sharp near-term decline in cash flows.

          contradiction: This 33.6% increase in input costs occurred while recovered service revenue from tenants decreased by 12.8%.
          reasoning: In commercial real estate, utility costs are typically pass-through expenses recovered via service charges. While utility costs rose by over a third, 'Service charges to tenants' (Note
            11) dropped from 7,765 to 6,773. Additionally, Note 11 cites a 'decrease in rent rates' as the cause for revenue decline. A massive spike in operational costs during a period of declining market
            rates and falling service revenue suggests a breakdown in business logic or an inability to manage core property expenses.

          contradiction: The actual finance cost recognized (AZN 15,748k) represents an effective interest rate of over 13% on the average liability.
          reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate used for interest-free shareholder loans is 4% (based on the CBAR refinancing rate). If the loans are measured at amortized cost, the finance cost in
            the P&L represents the unwinding of this discount. Finance costs of 15,748 (Note 12) on an average liability of roughly 118,400 (Note 9/10) implies an effective rate of 13.3%. Using a 4% rate
            for valuation while recognizing a 13.3% rate in the P&L is a direct logical contradiction.

          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows a 'Loan receivable' balance of AZN 768k (2024). The Statement of Cash Flows confirms these are related party loans by labeling the repayment
            accordingly. However, Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties), which is intended to be a comprehensive disclosure of related party exposures, fails to list this loan balance

          claim: Note 6 movement table for 2023 shows a 'Depreciation charge' of AZN 300 thousand for 'Construction in progress'.
          contradiction: Accounting logic and IFRS standards dictate that assets under construction are not depreciated as they are not yet available for use.
          reasoning: Construction in progress (CIP) represents assets still being built. Depreciation should only commence when the asset is ready for its intended use and transferred to the 'Building'
            category. Recording a depreciation charge against a CIP balance of 3,230 is a violation of basic accounting logic.

          reasoning: The Balance Sheet for 2023 shows total liabilities of 127,520 (Borrowings 124,307 + Payables/Taxes 3,213). In the Note 16 table, Borrowings are listed at 124,307 and Trade Payables
            at 4,213, which sum to 128,520. The reported 'Total' in the Note 16 table of 125,520 does not match the sum of its listed parts or the balance sheet total, indicating a failure in logical data

        contradiction: It is logically implausible to operate and maintain a large portfolio of investment properties (buildings and infrastructure) with a total workforce expense that only covers the CEO's
          compensation, implying zero operational staff.
        reasoning: According to the Statement of Profit or Loss, total staff costs for 2024 were AZN 98 thousand. Note 5 (Related Parties) confirms that 'Total key management compensation' (the Director)
          is exactly AZN 98 thousand. This implies the Company has no other employees. However, Note 6 shows the Company owns buildings and infrastructure with an original cost of over AZN 200 million and
          manages retail and office properties. Operating such a large physical asset base (maintenance, rent collection, security, facility management) without any non-management employees is a business

        contradiction: Revenue (rental income) from a property category cannot logically be negative under normal business operations.
        reasoning: Note 11 (Revenue) lists 'Office property' as (346) in thousands of AZN. While accounting adjustments or rebates can occur, a net negative revenue for an entire property class over a full
          fiscal year suggests either a fundamental data entry error or a logically impossible economic scenario where the landlord paid tenants more than the rent received.

        claim: Impairment calculations are based on a 10-year cash flow projection, while future minimum lease payments show a dramatic decline and represent only ~2.3 years of current revenue.
        contradiction: The assumption of a 10-year growth-based recovery in the impairment model contradicts the disclosed contractual lease pipeline which shows the business is rapidly losing its tenant
          base.
        reasoning: Note 6 states that impairment is determined using cash flow projections covering a ten-year period with a 3.3% long-term growth rate. However, the 'Future minimum lease payments receivable'
          table in the same note shows total undiscounted receivables of only AZN 45,158 thousand. Given 2024 revenue was AZN 19,721 thousand, the existing contracts cover less than 2.3 years of activity.
          Projecting 10 years of cash flows when the contractual backlog is minimal and declining (2023 backlog was 110k vs 2024 backlog of 45k) is logically aggressive.

        claim: Finance costs increased from AZN 13,285 thousand to AZN 14,748 thousand despite a decrease in debt principal and a significant reduction in the discount rate.
        contradiction: The cost of debt should logically decrease when the principal is reduced by 37% and the market interest rate used for discounting drops from 12% to 4%.
        reasoning: The Company repaid AZN 47,000 thousand of shareholder borrowings (Note 10). Note 4 states the discount rate dropped from 12% to 4%. For interest-free loans carried at amortized cost,
          a lower discount rate and lower principal should lead to lower interest (unwinding) expense. Instead, the P&L shows finance costs increased from 13,285 to 14,748. This is a temporal and economic
          contradiction.

        claim: The Company repaid AZN 47,000 thousand to shareholders despite reporting a loss of AZN 47,187 thousand and stating its existence depends on shareholder support.
        contradiction: Massive cash outflows to owners are logically inconsistent with a 'going concern' warning that claims the company needs owner support to survive.
        reasoning: In the 'Going concern' section of Note 4, management states the ability to continue depends on the 'willingness and ability of the shareholders to continue contributing funds.' However,
          the Cash Flow Statement shows the Company sent AZN 47,000 thousand back to the shareholders. Repaying nearly half of the available liquidity to owners while claiming to be financially dependent
          on them is a contradictory capital management strategy.

        contradiction: The narrative and primary financial statements provide a specific figure that is contradicted by the detailed asset note table.
        reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and the text in Note 6 explicitly cite an impairment of AZN 52,850 thousand. However, the movement table in Note 6 ('Detailed disclosure on movement of
          investment properties') shows an 'Impairment charge' of (61,064). This is an internal data mismatch that creates a logical inconsistency in the valuation of the company's primary asset.

        contradiction: The horizontal arithmetic in the Statement of Changes in Equity (SOCE) contains a random scalar value (100) that does not follow from the component items.
        reasoning: In the SOCE for 2024, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' shows 0 for Share Capital, (14,748) for Other Reserves, and 14,748 for Accumulated Deficit. The sum of these should be
          0. However, the 'Total' column for this row shows '100'. Furthermore, summing the 2023 balance (74,922) with the 2024 movements (-47,187, -20,437, +100) results in 7,398, while the table reports
          7,298. This is a structural logical error in the equity roll-forward.

        claim: Fair value of investment properties is exactly equal to the carrying value (at cost) despite massive impairments and a volatile market.
        contradiction: It is logically improbable for the Level 3 fair value (based on external market/income inputs) to perfectly match the depreciated/impaired cost basis of AZN 120,655 thousand.
        reasoning: Note 16 (Fair Value) states the Level 3 fair value for Investment properties is 120,655 and the carrying value is 120,655. Usually, fair value and cost (less impairment) differ unless
          the impairment was specifically calibrated to match a fair value exactly, but Note 6 says impairment was based on 'Value in Use' (an entity-specific measure), not Fair Value (a market-participant
          measure). This suggests a lack of independent valuation logic.

        contradiction: It is logically impossible for a sub-component of an asset class (related party receivables) to exceed the total reported value of that asset class on the Statement of Financial Position.
        reasoning: In Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties), the 'Gross amount of other receivables' with 'Entities under common control' as of 31 December 2023 is stated as 34,967. However,
          the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) as of 31 December 2023 reports total 'Trade and other receivables' as only 25,584. A subset cannot be larger than the whole.

        claim: The carrying value of Buildings and Infrastructure was calculated by adding the annual depreciation charge to the opening balance.
        contradiction: Depreciation is an expense that reduces the carrying value of an asset; adding it back to increase the book value is a fundamental violation of accounting logic.
        reasoning: 'In the Note 6 movement table for 2024, the ending carrying amount for ''Building and infrastructure'' (44,864) is mathematically derived as: 101,885 (Opening) + 144 (Transfer) - 278
          (Disposals) + 70 (Acc. Dep. Disposals) + 4,107 (Depreciation charge) - 61,064 (Impairment charge) = 44,864. The arithmetic only holds if the depreciation charge of 4,107 is added. If it were correctly

        contradiction: Assets under construction are logically and according to IFRS standards not subject to depreciation until they are completed and available for use.
        reasoning: The detailed disclosure table in Note 6 shows a 'Depreciation charge' of (300) in 2023 specifically allocated to the 'Construction in progress' column. Since CIP represents assets not

        contradiction: For interest-free loans measured at amortized cost, the finance cost (unwinding of discount) must logically equal the discount rate applied to the principal.
        reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate for shareholder borrowings is 4% for 2024. Note 10 shows an 'Interest accrual' of 14,748 on a beginning balance of 124,307 (or 77,307 after the 47,000
          repayment). An expense of 14,748 on a liability in this range represents an effective rate significantly higher than the claimed 4% market rate, suggesting the unwinding logic is inconsistent

          and 0 to the 'Shareholder'. This contradicts the 2023 disclosure where the cost was correctly attributed to the 'Shareholder' (13,285) and ignores the physical reality of the debt contract.

        reasoning: Note 6 explicitly lists 'Land' with a useful life of '50 [years]' in the depreciation table. While the movement table shows zero depreciation actually taken on land, the stated policy
          is a logical anomaly as land does not 'wear out' over 50 years in a way that requires cost allocation.

        reasoning: In the Statement of Profit or Loss, 'Finance income' is reported as 112. However, in the Statement of Cash Flows, under 'Adjustments for:', the line 'Finance income' shows (212). Typically,
          this adjustment reverses the non-cash portion of the income reported in the P&L. Adjusting for 100 more than was actually recorded as income is logically inconsistent and suggests either an incorrect
          adjustment or missing income in the P&L.

          contradiction.
        reasoning: The Statement of Changes in Equity for 2023 lists a 'Loss on extinguishment of shareholder borrowings' of 133,442. However, Note 10 (Reconciliation of liabilities) shows the borrowing
          balance moving from 133,424 at the start of 2023 to 124,307 at the end of 2023, primarily through remeasurement and interest. If the debt were extinguished, the closing balance in the reconciliation

        reasoning: In Note 10, for the year 2024, 'Remeasurement changes' is listed as 20,437 in the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column but as 25,437 in the 'Total' column. Consequently, the ending balance
          for 2024 is listed as 112,492 in the borrowing column and 117,492 in the total column. Since borrowings are the only item in the table, these columns should be identical; the 5,000 variance is

        contradiction: The actual depreciation charge is logically inconsistent with the minimum threshold established by the Company's own accounting policy.
        reasoning: Note 6 states the useful life for buildings and infrastructure is '3 to 40 years', which implies a minimum annual depreciation rate of 2.5% (1/40). However, the 2024 movement table shows
          a depreciation charge of 4,107 on an opening cost basis of 200,450, resulting in an effective rate of only 2.05%. This rate implies a useful life of approximately 49 years, which exceeds the maximum

        claim: The Statement of Cash Flows adjusts for AZN 309 thousand in 'Other non-cash operating costs', which exceeds the total amount of available expense categories in the P&L.
        contradiction: An adjustment for non-cash expenses cannot logically exceed the total expenses of that nature reported in the profit or loss statement.
        reasoning: The Statement of Cash Flows (2024) includes a non-cash adjustment of 309. In the Statement of Profit or Loss, 'Other expenses' is only 26, 'Professional Fees' is 41, and 'Staff costs'
          is 98. Even if all these items were entirely non-cash, their sum (165) is significantly lower than the 309 adjustment. This suggests the cash flow statement is 'reversing' expenses that do not
          exist in the reported income statement.

        claim: Service charge revenue decreased by 13% while the underlying utility costs increased by 33%.
        contradiction: It is logically inconsistent for a landlord to experience a sharp decline in service charge recovery (revenue) during a period of rapidly rising service-related costs (utilities).
        reasoning: Note 11 shows 'Service charges to tenants' fell from 7,765 in 2023 to 6,773 in 2024. Simultaneously, the Statement of Profit or Loss shows 'Utility costs' rose from 2,694 to 3,598. If
          service charges are designed to recover costs (as is standard for property management), the revenue should generally track the cost direction. A 33% increase in costs coupled with a 13% drop in
          recovery suggests a failure in the business logic of tenant recharging or data inconsistency.

        contradiction: Market-based discount rates for private entities logically include a risk premium over the central bank policy rate; using a rate nearly 50% lower than the base policy rate is economically
          implausible.
        reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate used for borrowings is 4%, based on the 'refinancing rate of Central bank'. However, the 'Operating Environment' section states the Central Bank of Azerbaijan
          (CBAR) policy rate was between 10.0% and 7.25% during 2024. A market participant would not lend to a loss-making entity at 4% when the risk-free policy rate is at least 7.25%, making the valuation

        reasoning: The Note 6 movement table for 2023 shows disposals of (3,040) and accumulated depreciation reversal of 233, implying a net book value of 2,807 was removed. The Statement of Cash Flows
          shows zero 'Proceeds from sale of investment property' and the P&L shows no 'Gain/loss on disposal'. The removal of nearly 3 million manats of assets without any economic trace is a logical gap.

          value write-downs in the same period.
        reasoning: The 'Operating Environment' note highlights 'significant growth' and a 4.1% GDP expansion for Azerbaijan in 2024. In contrast, Note 11 cites an 'Overall decrease rent rates' as the reason
          for lower revenue, and Note 6 records a massive impairment of 52,850 based on poor projected performance. Retail property values and rents are typically pro-cyclical; the company's performance

          in risk assessment.
        reasoning: Note 14 states 'global rating agencies have decreased their... sovereign credit ratings on Azerbaijan' but concludes 'based on detailed analysis no significant risk identified.' A downgrade
          in sovereign rating increases country risk, cost of capital, and potential currency volatility, which are inherently significant risks for a company financed by shareholder loans and dependent

        reasoning: '1. Opening balance: 175,322. 2. Additions: 498. 3. Disposals (net): (208). 4. Impairment: (61,064). 5. If we subtract depreciation (4,107), the balance would be 110,441. 6. The table
          reports 118,655, which is only reachable if the depreciation of 4,107 is added (175,322 + 498 - 208 + 4,107 - 61,064 = 118,655).'

        reasoning: 1. Note 4 states the discount rate used is 4%. 2. The 'Operating Environment' section states the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR) policy rate is 7.25%. 3. Typically, a commercial entity's
          borrowing rate (market rate) should be higher than the central bank's policy rate to reflect higher risk. Using 4% is economically unrealistic.

        contradiction: Land is a non-depreciable asset under IFRS and general business logic as it has an infinite useful life.
        reasoning: In the Material Accounting Policy section of Note 6, the table for 'Useful lives in years' explicitly lists 'Land' with a useful life of '50' years. Logically and according to accounting
          standards, land does not wear out or get used up over time; therefore, assigning it a finite life for depreciation is a semantic and logical contradiction of the asset's nature.

        contradiction: Assets under construction are not yet available for use and therefore cannot logically or legally be depreciated.
        reasoning: The movement table in Note 6 for the year 2023 shows a 'Depreciation charge' of (300) in the 'Construction in progress' column. By definition, construction in progress represents assets
          that are not yet complete or operational. Depreciation only begins when an asset is available for its intended use. Charging depreciation on incomplete construction is a logical impossibility

          However, the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) shows 'Total current liabilities' for 2023 as only 3,213 (comprising Trade payables of 2,853 and Other taxes of 360). The carrying

        reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate used for determination of borrowings is 4%. However, the P&L shows finance costs of 14,748 on an average borrowing balance of roughly 118,400 ((124,307+112,492)/2).
          This results in an effective interest rate of ~12.4%. If the liability was measured using a 4% market rate as claimed, the interest accrual should be approximately 4,700, not 14,748. The two figures
          represent vastly different economic realities.

          but the 'Total' column for that same row is 25,437. Since there are no other columns contributing to the total, these two numbers must be identical. A 5,000 thousand discrepancy exists within

        reasoning: Note 6 'Future minimum lease payments' table shows total undiscounted receivables falling from 110,374 in 2023 to 45,158 in 2024. This is a catastrophic decline in forward-looking business
          volume. However, the 'Operating Environment' section describes Azerbaijan's economy as demonstrating 'significant growth' with GDP up 4.1%. The company's internal projections of losing over half

          leasing.
        reasoning: 1. Note 11 reports total Rent Income of 12,948 and says Baku Supermarket (Related Party) accounts for 71% (9,193). 2. Note 5 reports total Revenue from Related Parties as 15,591. 3. Subtracting
          the Rent (9,193) leaves 6,398 of 'Service Charges' paid by the related party. 4. Total Service Charges for the year (Note 11) are 6,773. 5. This implies the related party pays 94.5% of all service
          charges (6,398 / 6,773). It is logically inconsistent for a tenant to occupy ~71% of the space (implied by rent) but pay ~94% of the utility/facility costs, as these are typically distributed

        reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity for 2024, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' shows a decrease in Other Reserves of (14,748) and an identical increase in Accumulated Deficit
          of 14,748. Logically, the sum of this row in the 'Total' column must be 0. However, the report lists the total as 100. This implies either the math is wrong or an unexplained net creation of equity

        reasoning: 1. The Statement of Cash Flows reports 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289. 2. The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Loan receivable' falling from 940 (2023) to
          768 (2024), a decrease of only 172. 3. There is no 'Loan issuance' reported in investing activities to offset the repayment. Logically, if 289 was received, the balance should have dropped to

        reasoning: 1. Note 6 states the post-tax discount rate (WACC) is 14%. 2. The same note states the tax rate in Azerbaijan is 30%. 3. Mathematically, a pre-tax rate is calculated as Post-tax / (1
          - Tax Rate). For a 14% post-tax rate, the pre-tax rate must be 20% (0.14 / 0.7). 4. The company instead reports a pre-tax discount rate of 15% in the table. This is a logical contradiction; a
          15% pre-tax rate at a 30% tax rate would imply a post-tax rate of only 10.5%.

          The 'Total' column for this specific row is reported as '100'. Mathematically and logically, a reclassification within equity must sum to zero in the total column. This '100' adjustment appears

        reasoning: The 'Statement of Profit or Loss' shows 'Staff costs' of AZN 98 thousand. Note 5 (Related Parties) shows 'Total key management compensation' is also AZN 98 thousand. This identity suggests
          that the company has no other employees (administrative, maintenance, security, or operations) besides the Director. Given the scale of the investment property portfolio (retail stores and offices)
          and the millions spent on utility and facility costs, having no staff other than management is logically suspect and suggests misclassification of personnel costs or an incomplete staff cost disclosure.

          of shareholders to continue contributing funds'. However, the Statement of Cash Flows shows that in 2024, the company actually repaid AZN 47,000 thousand to shareholders (a cash outflow). It is

        reasoning: Standard IFRS practice is that Land has an infinite useful life and is not depreciated. The company's own movement table in Note 6 shows that for Land with a cost of AZN 70,207 thousand,
          the 'Accumulated depreciation' remained nil for both 2023 and 2024. Disclosing a 50-year useful life while simultaneously recording zero depreciation over time is logically inconsistent.

          Charge) - 61,064 (Impairment) = 118,655. Logically, a depreciation charge should be a deduction from the carrying amount. If it were correctly subtracted, the ending value would be 110,441. Treating

          pays AZN 6,398 thousand in service charges (15,591 - 9,193). Since total service charges for the company are only AZN 6,773 thousand (Note 11), the related party is paying 94.5% of all service
          charges. It is logically inconsistent for a tenant representing 71% of rental footprint to pay 94.5% of service costs unless they are significantly subsidizing other tenants, which contradicts
          the 'independent' nature of CGUs claimed in Note 6.

        claim: The recoverable amount of Investment Property was calculated using a 15% pre-tax discount rate and a 14% post-tax WACC, with a 30% tax rate.
        contradiction: These three figures are mathematically and logically inconsistent with each other.
        reasoning: A post-tax rate of 14% with a 30% corporate tax rate implies a pre-tax discount rate of 20% (14% / (1 - 0.30)). The company claims to use a 15% pre-tax rate, which would imply a post-tax
          rate of only 10.5%. Using 15% (pre-tax) and 14% (post-tax) simultaneously for a 30% tax environment is a logical impossibility.

        contradiction: The narrative label 'loss' contradicts the actual financial impact shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
        reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity (SCE) for 2023, the 'Loss on extinguishment of shareholder borrowings' is recorded as a positive amount (credit) of AZN 133,442 thousand, which increases
          total equity. By definition, a loss reduces equity. If the transaction increased equity, it was logically a gain or a contribution from owners. Labeling an equity-increasing event as a 'loss'
          is a narrative-to-data contradiction.

          under common control' (related party banks). Given the sovereign downgrade and the company's own financial distress (Note 4), claiming 'good' credit quality for cash held entirely within a related-party
          structure in a downgraded jurisdiction is a narrative contradiction.

          16 (Fair Value Disclosures), however, lists the carrying value for this item as AZN 4,213 thousand. There is no explanation for the additional AZN 1,000 thousand of liabilities included in the

        reasoning: In Note 10 (Reconciliation of liabilities from financing activities), the 'Remeasurement changes' for 2023 are reported as a reduction of AZN 22,402 thousand. However, in the Statement
          of Changes in Equity (SCE) for 2023, the 'Remeasurement of borrowings from shareholders' is reported as a reduction of AZN 111,040 thousand. It is logically inconsistent for the same debt adjustment
          to result in such widely different impacts (a difference of AZN 88.6 million) across two different disclosures.

        reasoning: Note 11 provides a detailed breakdown of revenue totaling AZN 19,721 thousand (Rent 12,948 + Service Charges 6,773). Note 6, which discusses the underlying assets (Investment Property)
          for this entire revenue stream, reports a total of only 15,988 thousand for the same period. There is an unexplained discrepancy of AZN 3,733 thousand (~19% of total revenue) between the revenue

        reasoning: Typically, the finance income adjustment in the operating section of the cash flow statement (to reconcile loss to cash) should match the amount recognized in the P&L. Here, there is
          a discrepancy of AZN 100 thousand (112 vs 212). This 100k difference appears as a 'plug' in the Statement of Changes in Equity ('Transfer to accumulated deficit' total column), suggesting a fundamental
          logical break between the income statement and the cash flow reconciliation.

        contradiction: The contractual lease pipeline disclosed in the same note shows a massive 56% decline in revenue and very low total future inflows.
        reasoning: The 'Future minimum lease payments receivable' table (Note 6) shows only AZN 8,569 thousand is due in Year 1, which is a 56% drop from the current year's revenue of 19,721 thousand. Furthermore,
          the total undiscounted lease payments for all future years combined is only AZN 45,158 thousand. It is logically inconsistent to support a carrying value of AZN 118.7 million based on a long-term
          growth model when the existing legal contracts cover less than 40% of that value and indicate a sharp near-term decline in cash flows.

        contradiction: This 33.6% increase in input costs occurred while recovered service revenue from tenants decreased by 12.8%.
        reasoning: In commercial real estate, utility costs are typically pass-through expenses recovered via service charges. While utility costs rose by over a third, 'Service charges to tenants' (Note
          11) dropped from 7,765 to 6,773. Additionally, Note 11 cites a 'decrease in rent rates' as the cause for revenue decline. A massive spike in operational costs during a period of declining market
          rates and falling service revenue suggests a breakdown in business logic or an inability to manage core property expenses.

        reasoning: Note 4 states the discount rate used for interest-free shareholder loans is 4% (based on the CBAR refinancing rate). If the loans are measured at amortized cost, the finance cost in the
          P&L represents the unwinding of this discount. Finance costs of 15,748 (Note 12) on an average liability of roughly 118,400 (Note 9/10) implies an effective rate of 13.3%. Using a 4% rate for
          valuation while recognizing a 13.3% rate in the P&L is a direct logical contradiction.

        reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows a 'Loan receivable' balance of AZN 768k (2024). The Statement of Cash Flows confirms these are related party loans by labeling the repayment
          accordingly. However, Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties), which is intended to be a comprehensive disclosure of related party exposures, fails to list this loan balance in
          its tables for 2024 or 2023.

        reasoning: Construction in progress (CIP) represents assets still being built. Depreciation should only commence when the asset is ready for its intended use and transferred to the 'Building' category.
          Recording a depreciation charge against a CIP balance of 3,230 is a violation of basic accounting logic.

        reasoning: The Balance Sheet for 2023 shows total liabilities of 127,520 (Borrowings 124,307 + Payables/Taxes 3,213). In the Note 16 table, Borrowings are listed at 124,307 and Trade Payables at
          4,213, which sum to 128,520. The reported 'Total' in the Note 16 table of 125,520 does not match the sum of its listed parts or the balance sheet total, indicating a failure in logical data aggregation.

          reasoning: A comparison across primary statements and notes shows that while the Statement of Profit or Loss and the Statement of Cash Flows report finance costs of 14,748 thousand AZN for 2024,

          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and Statement of Cash Flows both record an impairment of 52,850 thousand AZN. This figure is also cited in the text of Note 6. However, the movement

            (98) - Fees (41) - Other (26) equals (32,551). The reported total is (30,551), a difference of 2,000 thousand AZN.'

          reasoning: Note 10 reports a remeasurement change of (22,402) for 2023. The Statement of Changes in Equity reports the remeasurement for the same period as (111,040), representing a major discrepancy
            in how this equity adjustment is quantified.

          reasoning: Note 11 states Baku Supermarket LLC contributed to 71% of the 2024 lease income (71% of 12,948 = 9,193). However, Note 5 (Table 5) reports revenue from entities under common control
            as 15,591, which exceeds the total lease income of 12,948, making the 71% concentration figure impossible.

          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and the Statement of Cash Flows both report an impairment loss of 52,850 thousand AZN for the year 2024. However, Table 10 ('Movement of Investment Properties')

            of the components in Note 11 (Rent income of 14,242 + Service charges of 7,765) equals 22,007, showing a 1,000 thousand AZN discrepancy with the primary income statement.

          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss reports Finance income of 112 thousand AZN. The Statement of Cash Flows adjustment for 'Finance income' is reported as (212) thousand AZN. Mathematical
            verification of the 'Operating cash flows before working capital changes' (14,156) in the Statement of Cash Flows confirms that the 212 figure was used for the calculation, creating a conflict
            with the P&L value of 112.

          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position reports 'Investment property' of 118,655 thousand AZN. However, Note 16 ('Fair Value Disclosures', Table 19) reports the 'Carrying value' for investment
            properties at cost as 120,655 thousand AZN for the same date.

          discrepancy: Significant discrepancies exist between the carrying amounts of liabilities reported in the Balance Sheet and those reported in the Fair Value note.
          reasoning: 'For 31 December 2024, the Balance Sheet reports ''Trade and other payables'' of 3,203 thousand AZN and ''Total Liabilities'' of 118,017 thousand AZN. Note 16 (Table 20) reports ''Trade
            and financial payables'' carrying value as 3,542 thousand AZN and ''Total Liabilities'' carrying value as 116,034 thousand AZN. For 31 December 2023, the Balance Sheet reports total liabilities
            of 127,520 thousand AZN, while Note 16 reports 125,520 thousand AZN. Additionally, Note 16 (Table 20) is internally inconsistent: the 2023 components (Borrowings 124,307 + Trade payables 4,213)
            sum to 128,520, not the 125,520 listed total.'

          reasoning: In Table 16 ('Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities'), the 'Borrowings from shareholders' column correctly reflects a closing balance of 112,492 thousand AZN
            for 2024, matching the Balance Sheet. However, the 'Total' column in the same table reports a closing balance of 117,492 thousand AZN and 'Remeasurement changes' of 25,437 thousand AZN (vs 20,437
            for the column), despite borrowings being the only component of the table.

          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position reports 'Trade and other receivables' of 25,584 thousand AZN as of 31 December 2023. However, Note 5 (Balances and Transactions with Related Parties)
            reports the 'Gross amount of other receivables' from 'Entities under common control' as 34,967 thousand AZN for the same date. A subset of receivables (related party) cannot logically exceed

          reasoning: 'Note 6 (Investment Property) states: ''Rental income and service fee from investment properties was AZN 15,988 thousand.'' However, both the Statement of Profit or Loss and Note 11
            (Revenue Breakdown) report total revenue of 19,721 thousand AZN for the year 2024. Even if ''Rental income'' (12,948) and ''Service charges'' (6,773) from Note 11 are summed, the result is 19,721,

          discrepancy: The 'Total' column in the Statement of Changes in Equity for the 2024 transfer between reserves and accumulated deficit contains a mathematical error.
          reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' for the year 2024 shows a decrease in 'Other reserves' of 14,748 thousand AZN and an increase in 'Accumulated
            deficit' of 14,748 thousand AZN. The 'Total' column for this row is reported as 100 thousand AZN. Since this is an internal transfer between equity components, the net impact on total equity

          discrepancy: The movement in the loan receivable balance on the balance sheet does not reconcile with the cash receipts reported in the Statement of Cash Flows.
          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Loan receivable' decreasing from 940 thousand AZN in 2023 to 768 thousand AZN in 2024, a net reduction of 172 thousand AZN. However, the Statement
            of Cash Flows reports 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 thousand AZN under investing activities. In the absence of new loan disbursements, the balance should have decreased
            by 289 thousand AZN (to 651 thousand AZN) rather than 172 thousand AZN.

          discrepancy: The counterparty classification for finance costs in 2024 is inconsistent between Note 5 and Note 12.
          reasoning: Note 12 (Finance Costs) attributes the interest expense to 'borrowings from shareholders.' Similarly, Note 9 and the Balance Sheet categorize the debt as 'Borrowings from shareholders.'
            However, Note 5 (Related Party Transactions) for 2024 lists 11,157 thousand AZN of finance cost under 'Entities under common control' while showing no finance costs under the 'Shareholder' column,

            'Impairment/(reversal) of financial assets' of 9,961 thousand AZN. While the signs correctly reflect a non-cash charge adjustment, the absolute values do not match.

          discrepancy: The magnitude of the remeasurement adjustment for shareholder borrowings in 2023 is highly inconsistent between the equity statement and the liability reconciliation note.
          reasoning: In the Statement of Changes in Equity, the 'Remeasurement of borrowings from shareholders' for 2023 is reported as (111,040) thousand AZN. Conversely, Note 10 ('Reconciliation of liabilities
            from financing activities') reports 'Remeasurement changes' of (22,402) thousand AZN for the same period. This represents a discrepancy of 88,638 thousand AZN.

            According to standard accounting principles (IAS 40/IAS 16), assets under construction are not depreciated until they are available for use and transferred to the relevant asset category.

            following it reports the same item as 101,885 thousand AZN. Mathematical verification (Cost 200,584 - Acc. Dep. 27,648 - Acc. Imp. 71,051) confirms 101,885 is the correct calculation, making

            118,655) only reconciles if X = 52,850, confirming that the 61,064 figure in Table 10 is a discrepancy.

            - Repayments 47,000 + Interest 14,748 + Remeasurement 20,437) results in 112,492 thousand AZN. The note also shows an internal mismatch in the 'Remeasurement changes' row (20,437 vs 25,437 total),

          reasoning: For 31 December 2024, the Balance Sheet (Table 0) reports 'Total Liabilities' of 118,017 thousand AZN. Note 16 (Table 20) reports 'Total Liabilities' carrying value as 116,034 thousand
            AZN, a discrepancy of 1,983 thousand AZN (which coincides with Contract Liabilities omitted from the Note). For 2023, the Balance Sheet reports 'Total Liabilities' of 127,520, while Note 16
            reports 125,520. Additionally, the components in Table 20 for 2023 (124,307 + 4,213) sum to 128,520, which matches neither the note total nor the balance sheet.

            these results in 0 (-14,748 + 14,748 = 0), but the table reports a 'Total' column value of 100. This is an internal mathematical inconsistency within the table.

            + 70 (Acc. Depr. Disposals) + 4,107 (Depreciation charge) - 61,064 (Impairment). The math confirms that 4,107 was added rather than subtracted. Depreciation is an expense that must reduce the

            in Note 11 (19,721 thousand AZN) reconciles to the Income Statement, the negative balance for a revenue stream is an accounting anomaly that typically indicates a classification error or an

            Flows reports 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 thousand AZN for the same period. In the absence of new loan disbursements, the balance should have decreased by the full

          reasoning: 'The Statement of Profit or Loss (Table 1) lists 2023 revenue as 21,007 thousand AZN. Note 11 (Table 17) provides a breakdown: Retail property (13,896), Office property (346), and Service
            charges (7,765). The sum of these components equals 22,007 thousand AZN, which matches the total printed in Note 11 but conflicts with the primary statement by 1,000 thousand AZN.'

          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss (Table 1) reports a 'Reversal/ (charge) of impairment on other assets' of (9,959) thousand AZN for 2023. The Statement of Cash Flows (Table 3) reports
            an adjustment for 'Impairment/(reversal) of financial assets' of 9,961 thousand AZN. While these items represent the same adjustment, the values differ by 2 thousand AZN, likely due to a minor

          discrepancy: The accounting policy for land depreciation in Note 6 contradicts the lack of depreciation recorded in the investment property movement table.
          severity: medium
          reasoning: Table 9 (Note 6 - Useful Lives) explicitly states that Land has a useful life of 50 years and is subject to depreciation. However, Table 10 (Movement of Investment Properties) shows
            that the carrying amount for Land remained static at 70,207 thousand AZN across 2023 and 2024, with zero depreciation charges recorded. This is a direct contradiction between disclosed policy
            and financial reporting practice.

          severity: medium
          reasoning: Table 10 (Note 6) records a 'Depreciation charge' of 300 thousand AZN for the 'Construction in progress' category in 2023. Assets under construction are typically not depreciated until
            they are completed and transferred to 'Building and infrastructure'. Furthermore, the 'Useful Lives' table (Table 9) only specifies depreciation lives for Buildings and Land, omitting CIP, which
            suggests depreciation on CIP is an accounting error.

            identical to key management compensation.
          contradiction: It is logically implausible to operate and maintain a large portfolio of investment properties (buildings and infrastructure) with a total workforce expense that only covers the
            CEO's compensation, implying zero operational staff.
          reasoning: According to the Statement of Profit or Loss, total staff costs for 2024 were AZN 98 thousand. Note 5 (Related Parties) confirms that 'Total key management compensation' (the Director)
            is exactly AZN 98 thousand. This implies the Company has no other employees. However, Note 6 shows the Company owns buildings and infrastructure with an original cost of over AZN 200 million
            and manages retail and office properties. Operating such a large physical asset base (maintenance, rent collection, security, facility management) without any non-management employees is a business

          reasoning: Note 11 (Revenue) lists 'Office property' as (346) in thousands of AZN. While accounting adjustments or rebates can occur, a net negative revenue for an entire property class over a
            full fiscal year suggests either a fundamental data entry error or a logically impossible economic scenario where the landlord paid tenants more than the rent received.

          claim: Impairment calculations are based on a 10-year cash flow projection, while future minimum lease payments show a dramatic decline and represent only ~2.3 years of current revenue.
          contradiction: The assumption of a 10-year growth-based recovery in the impairment model contradicts the disclosed contractual lease pipeline which shows the business is rapidly losing its tenant
            base.
          reasoning: Note 6 states that impairment is determined using cash flow projections covering a ten-year period with a 3.3% long-term growth rate. However, the 'Future minimum lease payments receivable'
            table in the same note shows total undiscounted receivables of only AZN 45,158 thousand. Given 2024 revenue was AZN 19,721 thousand, the existing contracts cover less than 2.3 years of activity.
            Projecting 10 years of cash flows when the contractual backlog is minimal and declining (2023 backlog was 110k vs 2024 backlog of 45k) is logically aggressive.

          contradiction: The cost of debt should logically decrease when the principal is reduced by 37% and the market interest rate used for discounting drops significantly.
          reasoning: The Company repaid AZN 47,000 thousand of shareholder borrowings (Note 10). Note 4 states the discount rate dropped from 12% to 4%. For interest-free loans carried at amortized cost,
            a lower discount rate and lower principal should lead to lower interest (unwinding) expense. Instead, the P&L shows finance costs increased from 13,285 to 14,748. Furthermore, finance costs
            of 14,748 on an average liability of roughly 118,400 implies an effective rate of ~12.4%, contradicting the stated 4% discount rate.

          reasoning: In the 'Going concern' section of Note 4, management states the ability to continue depends on the 'willingness and ability of the shareholders to continue contributing funds.' However,
            the Cash Flow Statement shows the Company sent AZN 47,000 thousand back to the shareholders. Repaying nearly half of the available liquidity to owners while claiming to be financially dependent

          contradiction: The narrative and primary financial statements provide a specific figure that is contradicted by the detailed asset note table.
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss and the text in Note 6 explicitly cite an impairment of AZN 52,850 thousand. However, the movement table in Note 6 ('Detailed disclosure on movement

            a reclassification.
          reasoning: In the SOCE for 2024, the row 'Transfer to accumulated deficit' shows 0 for Share Capital, (14,748) for Other Reserves, and 14,748 for Accumulated Deficit. The sum of these should be
            0. However, the 'Total' column for this row shows '100'. Furthermore, summing the 2023 balance (74,922) with the 2024 movements (-47,187, -20,437, +100) results in 7,398, while the table reports

          contradiction: It is logically improbable for Level 3 fair value to perfectly match cost basis, and the carrying value reported in the fair value note contradicts the face of the balance sheet.
          reasoning: Note 16 states the Level 3 fair value for Investment properties is 120,655 and the carrying value is 120,655. This suggests a lack of independent valuation logic as cost and fair value
            rarely match perfectly. Additionally, the Balance Sheet reports a carrying value of 118,655. Even excluding Construction in Progress (3,584), the values (118,655 - 3,584 = 115,071) do not reconcile

          claim: The carrying value of Buildings and Infrastructure was calculated by adding the annual depreciation charge to the opening balance in the movement table.
          contradiction: Depreciation is an expense that reduces carrying value; adding it back to increase book value is a fundamental violation of accounting logic.
          reasoning: In the Note 6 movement table for 2024, the ending carrying amount for 'Building and infrastructure' (44,864) is mathematically derived only if the depreciation charge of 4,107 is added
            to the balance instead of subtracted. Opening (175,322) + Additions (498) - Disposals (208) + 4,107 (Depreciation) - 61,064 (Impairment) = 118,655 total. This logic treats depreciation as a

            depreciating them contradicts the nature of the asset and IFRS standards.

            plus 'Other taxes payable' (360), totaling 3,213. The fair value table reports a carrying value that is 1,000 thousand higher than the balance sheet.

            logical anomaly as land does not require cost allocation over a finite period.

          reasoning: In the Statement of Profit or Loss, 'Finance income' is 112. In the Statement of Cash Flows, the 'Finance income' adjustment is (212). Typically, this reverses the amount in the P&L.

          reasoning: The SCE for 2023 lists an 'extinguishment' of 133,442. However, Note 10 shows the borrowing balance continuing from 2023 to 2024. Furthermore, the 133,442 is recorded as a credit (increase)
            to equity but labeled as a 'loss', which is a narrative contradiction.

          reasoning: In Note 10 for 2024, 'Remeasurement changes' is 20,437 in the 'Borrowings' column but 25,437 in the 'Total' column. The ending balance is 112,492 in the borrowing column and 117,492
            in the total column. Since borrowings are the only item, these should be identical; the 5,000 variance is an internal math failure.

          contradiction: Using a discount rate nearly 50% lower than the base sovereign policy rate is economically implausible for a loss-making entity.

          reasoning: Note 14 states 'global rating agencies have decreased their... sovereign credit ratings' but concludes 'no significant risk identified.' For an entity dependent on local markets and

          reasoning: Note 11 reports Rent Income of 12,948; a 71% share is 9,193. Note 5 reports related party revenue as 15,591, implying 6,398 in service charges. Total service charges are only 6,773

          reasoning: Cash Flow reports 289 in repayments. Balance Sheet shows 'Loan receivable' fell from 940 to 768 (a 172 decrease). Without reported new lending, the balance should have dropped to 651.

          reasoning: With a 30% tax rate, a 14% post-tax rate requires a 20% pre-tax rate (14/0.7). A 15% pre-tax rate would imply a 10.5% post-tax rate. Reporting 15% and 14% simultaneously is a mathematical

            a lower discount rate and lower principal should lead to lower interest (unwinding) expense. However, the P&L and Note 10 show interest accrual of 14,748. An expense of 14,748 on an average

          contradiction: Depreciation is an expense that reduces carrying value; adding it back to increase book value is a fundamental violation of accounting logic.
          severity: high
          reasoning: 'In the Note 6 movement table for 2024, the ending carrying amount for ''Building and infrastructure'' (44,864) is mathematically derived only if the depreciation charge of 4,107 is
            added to the balance instead of subtracted. Calculation: Opening (101,885) - Disposals (278) + Acc. Dep of Disposals (70) + Transfer (144) + 4,107 (Depreciation) - 61,064 (Impairment) = 44,864.

          reasoning: Note 11 reports total Rent Income of 12,948 thousand; a 71% share for Baku Supermarket equals 9,193 thousand. Note 5 reports total revenue from related parties (Entities under common
            control) as 15,591 thousand. This implies that 6,398 thousand (15,591 - 9,193) consists of service charges paid by this one tenant. However, Note 11 lists the company's total service charge
            revenue as only 6,773 thousand. This results in an illogical concentration where a single tenant pays ~95% of service fees despite providing only 71% of rent, indicating a likely error in the

          reasoning: In Note 6, the Company reports a post-tax WACC of 14% and a pre-tax discount rate of 15%, while explicitly stating the tax rate is 30%. Mathematically, a 15% pre-tax rate at a 30% tax
            rate results in a 10.5% post-tax rate (15% * (1 - 0.3)). Alternatively, a 14% post-tax rate would require a 20% pre-tax rate (14% / 0.7). Using both 14% and 15% in the same valuation context
            is a mathematical impossibility that affects the reliability of the impairment testing for the Company's largest asset.

          reasoning: The SCE for 2023 lists an 'extinguishment' of 133,442. However, Note 10 shows the borrowing balance continuing from 2023 to 2024. Furthermore, the 133,442 is recorded as a credit (increase)

            error regarding the company's largest asset.

          contradiction: It is logically impossible for a sub-component of an asset class (related party receivables) to exceed the total reported value of that asset class on the Statement of Financial

            However, the Statement of Financial Position reports total 'Trade and other receivables' as only 25,584 for the same period. This indicates a significant misstatement in either the related party

          claim: The carrying value of Buildings and Infrastructure was calculated by adding the annual depreciation charge to the opening balance in the movement table.
          contradiction: Depreciation is an expense that reduces carrying value; adding it back to increase book value is a fundamental violation of accounting logic.
          severity: high
          reasoning: 'In the Note 6 movement table for 2024, the ending carrying amount for ''Building and infrastructure'' (44,864) is mathematically derived only if the depreciation charge of 4,107 is
            added to the balance instead of subtracted. Calculation: Opening (101,885) - Disposals (278) + Acc. Dep of Disposals (70) + Transfer (144) + 4,107 (Depreciation) - 61,064 (Impairment) = 44,864.

          reasoning: 'The movement table in Note 6 shows a ''Depreciation charge'' of (300) in 2023 specifically allocated to the ''Construction in progress'' column. The ending balance of 3,230 is calculated
            as: 2,890 (Opening) + 1,225 (Additions) - 585 (Transfer) - 300 (Depreciation). Since CIP represents assets not yet in service, depreciating them contradicts standard IFRS accounting principles.'

          reasoning: The Cash Flow adjustment is 309. In the P&L, 'Other expenses' (26), 'Professional Fees' (41), and 'Staff costs' (98) sum to only 165. The adjustment reversals expenses that do not exist

            lists 'Total finance costs recognised in profit or loss' as 15,748 thousand. This 1,000 thousand difference is an unexplained internal inconsistency between the primary statements and the disclosures.

          claim: Baku Supermarket LLC contributes 71% of lease income, yet the implied service charge recovery is 94.5%.

          severity: medium
          reasoning: Note 11 reports total Rent Income of 12,948 thousand; a 71% share for Baku Supermarket equals 9,193 thousand. Note 5 reports total revenue from related parties (Entities under common
            control) as 15,591 thousand. This implies that 6,398 thousand (15,591 - 9,193) consists of service charges paid by this one tenant. However, Note 11 lists the company's total service charge
            revenue as only 6,773 thousand. This results in an illogical concentration where a single tenant pays ~95% of service fees despite providing only 71% of rent, indicating a likely error in the

          severity: medium
          reasoning: The Statement of Cash Flows reports AZN 289 thousand in loan repayments received. However, the Statement of Financial Position shows the 'Loan receivable' balance decreased from AZN
            940 thousand to AZN 768 thousand, representing a decline of only AZN 172 thousand. Without disclosure of new loans issued or other non-cash adjustments that would increase the balance, the asset
            should have decreased to AZN 651 thousand. This discrepancy indicates an inconsistency between the reported cash movements and the asset's carrying value.

          contradiction: The relationship between pre-tax and post-tax rates is mathematically and logically inconsistent with the stated tax rate.
          severity: high
          reasoning: In Note 6, the Company reports a post-tax WACC of 14% and a pre-tax discount rate of 15%, while explicitly stating the tax rate is 30%. Mathematically, a 15% pre-tax rate at a 30% tax
            rate results in a 10.5% post-tax rate (15% * (1 - 0.3)). Alternatively, a 14% post-tax rate would require a 20% pre-tax rate (14% / 0.7). Using both 14% and 15% in the same valuation context
            is a mathematical impossibility that affects the reliability of the impairment testing for the Company's largest asset.

            This 5,000 thousand AZN difference stems from the 'Remeasurement changes' row, where the 'Total' column reports 25,437 while the only component column reports 20,437.

            Flows reports 'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 thousand AZN for the same period. In the absence of new loan disbursements, the balance should have decreased by the full
            repayment amount of 289 thousand AZN, resulting in an unexplained discrepancy of 117 thousand AZN.

          reasoning: Note 12 (Finance Costs) and the Statement of Financial Position attribute interest expense and debt to 'borrowings from shareholders.' Conversely, Note 5 (Related Party Transactions)
            for 2024 lists 11,157 thousand AZN of finance costs under 'Entities under common control' while reporting zero for the 'Shareholder' column. This contradicts the source of the underlying liability

            in Note 11 (19,721 thousand AZN) reconciles to the Income Statement, the negative balance for a revenue stream is an accounting anomaly that typically indicates a classification error or an

            Typically, non-cash adjustments in the SCF should match the income statement figure to reverse its effect on profit; a difference of 100 thousand AZN exists here which suggests either a classification

            - Repayments 47,000 + Interest 14,748 + Remeasurement 20,437) results in 112,492 thousand AZN. The note also shows an internal mismatch in the 'Remeasurement changes' row (20,437 vs 25,437 total),

            amount of other receivables' from 'Entities under common control' alone as 34,967 thousand AZN. It is logically impossible for a subset of receivables from related parties to be larger than

            these results in 0 (-14,748 + 14,748 = 0), but the table reports a 'Total' column value of 100. This is an internal mathematical inconsistency within the table.

            the Fair Value note (Table 20) lists the carrying value of ''Trade and financial payables'' as 4,213 thousand AZN. This creates a 1,000 thousand AZN discrepancy in the carrying value of current

            an adjustment for 'Impairment/(reversal) of financial assets' of 9,961 thousand AZN. While these items represent the same adjustment, the values differ by 2 thousand AZN, likely due to a minor

          reasoning: Table 9 (Note 6 - Useful Lives) explicitly states that Land has a useful life of 50 years and is subject to depreciation. However, Table 10 (Movement of Investment Properties) shows
            that the carrying amount for Land remained static at 70,207 thousand AZN across 2023 and 2024, with zero depreciation charges recorded. This is a direct contradiction between disclosed policy

          reasoning: Table 10 (Note 6) records a 'Depreciation charge' of 300 thousand AZN for the 'Construction in progress' category in 2023. Assets under construction are typically not depreciated until
            they are completed and transferred to 'Building and infrastructure'. Furthermore, the 'Useful Lives' table (Table 9) only specifies depreciation lives for Buildings and Land, omitting CIP, which
            suggests depreciation on CIP is an accounting error.

          reasoning: The interest expense for 2024 is reported as 14,748 thousand AZN in both the Income Statement (Table 1) and Note 10 (Table 16). Given the average shareholder borrowing balance of 118,399.5
            thousand AZN, the effective interest rate is approximately 12.45%. This is materially higher than the 4% rate disclosed in Note 4. Additionally, Note 12 (Table 18) reports 15,748 thousand AZN
            for the same period, creating a further 1,000 thousand AZN internal discrepancy.

          discrepancy: The 'Total' column for accumulated impairment at 1 January 2023 in Note 6 does not equal the sum of its individual components.
          severity: high
          reasoning: In Table 10 (Movement of Investment Properties), the row 'Accumulated impairment' at 1 January 2023 lists (71,051) for Buildings and infrastructure and zero/blank for Land and Construction
            in progress. However, the 'Total' column for that same row reports (72,051). The sum of the individual components is (71,051), resulting in an unexplained mathematical error of 1,000 thousand
            AZN within the table.

            12.
          severity: high
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss (Table 1) and Statement of Cash Flows (Table 3) both report Finance costs of 14,748 thousand AZN for 2024. This figure is also supported by the 'Interest
            accrual' line in Note 10 (Table 16). However, Note 12 (Table 18) reports an 'Interest expense on borrowings from shareholders' and a total recognised in profit or loss of 15,748 thousand AZN,
            creating a 1,000 thousand AZN discrepancy.

          severity: high
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss (Table 1) and Statement of Cash Flows (Table 3) both record an impairment charge of 52,850 thousand AZN for 2024. In contrast, the 'Impairment charge'
            line in the Note 6 movement table (Table 10) lists 61,064 thousand AZN, resulting in a material discrepancy of 8,214 thousand AZN.

          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss (Table 1) shows Finance income of 112 thousand AZN. However, the Statement of Cash Flows (Table 3) uses (212) thousand AZN as the adjustment for finance
            income in the operating cash flows reconciliation, indicating a mismatch of 100 thousand AZN.

          reasoning: 'The Statement of Profit or Loss (Table 1) lists 2023 revenue as 21,007 thousand AZN. Note 11 (Table 17) provides a breakdown: Retail property (13,896), Office property (346), and Service
            charges (7,765). The sum of these components equals 22,007 thousand AZN, which matches the total printed in Note 11 but conflicts with the primary statement by 1,000 thousand AZN.'

          severity: high
          reasoning: Note 10 (Table 16) reports an ending balance of 112,492 for 'Borrowings from shareholders' but 117,492 in the 'Total' column. This is caused by an inconsistent remeasurement change
            entry (20,437 in the sub-column vs 25,437 in the Total column). The Balance Sheet (Table 0) confirms the correct balance should be 112,492.

          severity: high
          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position (Table 0) for 2023 shows 'Trade and other payables' (2,853) and 'Other taxes payable' (360), totaling 3,213. Note 16 (Table 20) reports a carrying
            value of 4,213, which is 1,000 thousand AZN higher than the total available pool of current liabilities.

          severity: high
          reasoning: Note 6 (Table 6) reports a gross amount of other receivables from entities under common control as 34,967 for 2023. This sub-component value is significantly higher than the total balance
            of 25,584 reported for the entire 'Trade and other receivables' line item in the Statement of Financial Position (Table 0).

          severity: high
          reasoning: In Note 6 (Table 10), the 2024 depreciation charge of 4,107 is listed as a positive value and was added to the sub-total to calculate the reported ending balance of 118,655. Verification
            using the opening balance (175,322) plus additions (498), less disposals (278), plus dep of disposals (70), plus dep charge (4,107), less impairment (61,064) equals exactly 118,655. Subtracting
            the charge as per accounting standards would result in a balance of 110,441.

            Position (172 thousand AZN).
          severity: medium
          reasoning: The Statement of Financial Position shows 'Loan receivable' decreasing from 940 (2023) to 768 (2024), representing a net reduction of 172. However, the Statement of Cash Flows reports
            'Loan repayments received from related parties' of 289 for the same period. The discrepancy of 117 indicates that the cash movement does not reconcile with the changes in the reported balance,
            suggesting potential misclassification of interest or other movements.

          severity: high
          reasoning: The Statement of Changes in Equity reports a transfer of 14,748 from 'Other reserves' to 'Accumulated deficit'. Since this is an internal transfer between equity components, the net
            impact on the 'Total' equity column should be zero (-14,748 + 14,748 = 0). The reported value of 100 is a significant arithmetic error in a primary financial statement.

          severity: low
          reasoning: The Statement of Profit or Loss reports a charge of 9,959 for 2023. The Statement of Cash Flows uses 9,961 for the corresponding non-cash adjustment. This represents a minor discrepancy
            of 2 thousand AZN, which is likely a rounding error but constitutes a technical inconsistency between the statements.

          severity: medium
          reasoning: Note 11 shows 'Office property' revenue as -346 for 2024, compared to 346 in 2023. Revenue is typically an inflow; a negative balance suggests a complete reversal of a prior year accrual
            or a significant refund. This reporting is inconsistent with standard revenue presentation and suggests a potential misclassification or accounting correction that lacks separate disclosure.

          reasoning: Note 10 reports a remeasurement change of (22,402) for 2023. The Statement of Changes in Equity reports the remeasurement for the same period as (111,040), representing a major discrepancy
            in how this equity adjustment is quantified across the financial statements.

          discrepancy: The financial assets measurement table in Note 17 omits trade receivables and loan receivables reported on the Balance Sheet.
          severity: high
          reasoning: Note 17 (Table 21) identifies only "Cash and cash equivalents" (431) as financial assets for 2024. However, the Statement of Financial Position (Table 0) reports "Trade and other receivables"
            (5,232) and "Loan receivable" (768), both of which are financial assets required to be disclosed under IFRS 9 measurement categories. This results in the omission of 6,000 (approximately 93%)
            of total financial assets from the measurement category note. A similar omission occurs for 2023, where 26,524 in receivables are excluded from the Note 17 total of 596.

          *   **Incorporation & Ownership:** Claims regarding the registration date (September 21, 2015), the specific registered address (155 XXX Avenue), and the ownership by "Idea LLC" and "Standard
          LLC" (controlled by Fazil Fazilov) could not be verified. These are likely private entities with no publicly accessible registry data in Azerbaijan.

          *   **Management:** Vugar Vugarov (CEO) and Orkhan Hamidov (CFO) could not be verified through public executive directories or corporate press releases.


          #### **Economic & Market Indicators**

          *   **Central Bank Rates (CONTRADICTED):** The report claims CBAR policy rates moved from 10.0% to 7.25% in 2024. Official CBAR data shows the rate started the year at **8.0%** and was cut to
          **7.25%**. Similarly, the "refinancing rates" used for accounting estimates (4% and 12%) do not align with official benchmarks (7.25% and 8.0%).

          *   **GDP Data (CONTRADICTED):** The report states a 2024 GDP of 116.3 billion manats. Official statistics report a nominal GDP of **126.3 billion manats** for 2024.

          *   **Foreign Reserves (CONTRADICTED):** The claimed 5.1% decrease in reserves is contradicted by CBA data showing a **5.6% decrease** in CBA-specific reserves, while total strategic reserves
          (including SOFAZ) actually **increased by 3.6%**.

          *   **Tax Rate (CONTRADICTED):** The report claims a 30% tax rate in Azerbaijan. The standard corporate income tax rate is verified at **20%**.

          *   **Sovereign Ratings (CONTRADICTED):** Contrary to the claim of ratings decreases, **Fitch upgraded Azerbaijan** to ''BBB-'' (investment grade) in 2024, and S&P affirmed its rating with a stable
          outlook.

          | **Tax Rate** | CONTRADICTED | Official corporate tax rate is 20%, not 30%. |
