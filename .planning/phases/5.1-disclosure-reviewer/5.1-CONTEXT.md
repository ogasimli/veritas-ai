# Phase 5.1: Disclosure Reviewer - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Add a Reviewer agent to the disclosure_compliance pipeline that acts as a quality gate for false positives. Currently, the FanOutVerifier agents check each IFRS standard independently and flag missing disclosures, but they can produce false alarms when:

1. **Different wording/phrasing** - Disclosure exists but is written differently than the YAML checklist expects (e.g., "lease obligations" vs "right-of-use asset liabilities")
2. **Combined disclosures** - Multiple required disclosures are bundled together in one section, so individual checks fail but the information is actually present
3. **Cross-referenced disclosures** - Disclosure says "See Note 12" but the Verifier doesn't follow references, so it reports missing even though it's disclosed elsewhere

The Reviewer agent sits after the FanOutVerifier stage and re-examines flagged "missing" disclosures to filter out false positives before reporting findings to auditors.

The pipeline becomes: Scanner → FanOutVerifier → **Reviewer** (matching numeric_validation's 3-stage pattern)

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Balanced precision/recall** - Significantly reduce false positives without filtering too aggressively. We still want to catch real missing disclosures. The goal is trust - auditors must feel confident that flagged findings are worth investigating.

- **False positive detection** - Must catch all three patterns:
  - Semantic equivalence (different phrasing but same meaning)
  - Combined disclosures (multiple requirements satisfied by one section)
  - Cross-references (disclosure exists via "See Note X" references)

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- **No new disclosure checking** - Reviewer only reviews Verifier findings. It doesn't run new checks or identify new missing disclosures.

- **No compliance interpretation** - Reviewer doesn't decide if a disclosure is "good enough" - it only filters obvious false positives where the disclosure clearly exists.

- **No document editing suggestions** - No "rewrite this section" or "use this wording" - just report missing vs present.

- **No deduplication or severity assignment** - Unlike numeric_validation's Reviewer, this agent focuses solely on false positive filtering. Keep it simple.

**In summary:** Reviewer is strictly a false-positive filter, not a compliance advisor.

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Mirror the numeric_validation architecture: Scanner → FanOutVerifier → Reviewer (SequentialAgent pattern)

- Reviewer receives all "missing disclosure" findings from FanOutVerifier agents across all standards

- For each flagged finding, Reviewer re-examines the document to verify the disclosure is truly missing:
  - Check for semantic equivalents (NLP/LLM-based matching)
  - Look for combined disclosures that satisfy multiple requirements
  - Follow cross-references (parse "See Note X" patterns and check referenced sections)

- If Reviewer confirms the disclosure exists (even in different form), filter it out

- If Reviewer confirms it's genuinely missing, pass the finding through

- Output: Filtered list of high-confidence missing disclosures

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This enhancement was identified after Phase 5 completion. The current disclosure_compliance pipeline works but likely produces false positives that could undermine auditor trust.

Adding the Reviewer stage brings disclosure_compliance to parity with numeric_validation's mature 3-stage architecture:

**numeric_validation:** Extractor → Verifier → Reviewer
**disclosure_compliance:** Scanner → FanOutVerifier → **Reviewer** ← NEW

The key difference: numeric Reviewer does filtering + deduplication + severity + summarization, while disclosure Reviewer focuses purely on false positive filtering (simpler scope).

User prioritizes balanced precision/recall over "catch everything" - better to have fewer, higher-quality findings than a noisy list that auditors ignore.
