# Phase 3.1 Plan 01: Root Orchestrator Agent Summary

**Root orchestrator agent implemented with ParallelAgent pattern, coordinating numeric_validation as first sub-agent. Restructured codebase to support future multi-agent orchestration.**

## Accomplishments

- Created orchestrator agent package with ParallelAgent structure
- Moved numeric_validation pipeline to orchestrator/sub_agents/ using git mv (preserved history)
- Updated DocumentProcessor to use orchestrator instead of direct numeric_validation
- Updated all test imports to reflect new module paths
- Established foundation for phases 4-6 agents to be added as parallel sub-agents

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `backend/agents/orchestrator/__init__.py` - Package exports for orchestrator
- `backend/agents/orchestrator/agent.py` - ParallelAgent definition coordinating sub-agents
- `backend/agents/orchestrator/sub_agents/__init__.py` - Sub-agent imports

**Moved (git history preserved):**
- `backend/agents/numeric_validation/*` → `backend/agents/orchestrator/sub_agents/numeric_validation/*` (entire directory tree including tests)

**Modified:**
- `backend/app/services/processor.py` - Updated to use orchestrator_agent, modified findings extraction to handle orchestrator output structure
- All test files in `numeric_validation/tests/` - Updated imports to new module paths

## Decisions Made

- Used ParallelAgent pattern to enable concurrent execution of future validation agents
- Preserved git history via `git mv` to maintain development lineage
- Updated findings extraction to access sub-agent state: `final_state.get("numeric_validation", {}).get("reviewer_output", {}).get("findings", [])`
- Kept agent_id as "numeric_validation" in DocumentProcessor for backward compatibility with database schema

## Issues Encountered

None - migration completed smoothly with all imports verified and git history preserved.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 3.1 complete. Root orchestrator structure ready for Phase 4-6 agents to be added as sub-agents:
- Phase 4: logic_consistency agent
- Phase 5: disclosure_compliance agent
- Phase 6: external_signal agent

Each future phase can add its agent to the `orchestrator_agent.sub_agents` list without modifying core structure.
