# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

**Core value:** Numeric validation accuracy — if the system can't reliably catch math errors and inconsistencies in financial tables, nothing else matters.
**Current focus:** All phases complete

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 8 (Backend WebSocket Support)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Completed
Last activity: 2026-01-24 - Completed Phase 8 Plan 1 (Backend WebSocket Support)

Progress: ████████████████ 100%

**Next Phase:** All phases complete - project ready for use


## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 20
- Average duration: 10.2m
- Total execution time: 3.44 hours

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 07-03, 07-04, 6.1-01, 6.1-02, 08-01
- Trend: Fast execution on well-researched tasks (8-01: 3m, 6.1-01, 6.1-02 - 2m each), UI tasks (07-* - 2-5m), moderate integration tasks (06-01 - 18m), complex features (05-01 - 38m)
