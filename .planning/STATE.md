# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

**Core value:** Numeric validation accuracy — if the system can't reliably catch math errors and inconsistencies in financial tables, nothing else matters.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 — External Signal Integration

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 7 (External Signal Integration)
Plan: 01 of 01 (Complete)
Status: Phase 6 Complete
Last activity: 2026-01-19 - Completed 6-01-PLAN.md

Progress: ████████████ 86%


## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 13
- Average duration: 14m
- Total execution time: 3.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 3 | 3 | 15m |
| 02-document-ingestion | 2 | 2 | 12m |
| 03-numeric-validation | 3 | 3 | 7m |
| 3.1-root-orchestrator-agent | 1 | 1 | 15m |
| 04-logic-consistency | 1 | 1 | 3m |
| 4.1-logic-reviewer | 1 | 1 | 3m |
| 05-disclosure-compliance | 1 | 1 | 38m |
| 5.1-disclosure-reviewer | 1 | 1 | 2m |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 04-01, 05-01, 4.1-01, 5.1-01, 06-01
- Trend: Fast refactoring tasks (4.1-01, 5.1-01), moderate integration tasks (06-01), complex features (05-01 longer due to Excel conversion + multi-agent pipeline)
