# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

**Core value:** Numeric validation accuracy — if the system can't reliably catch math errors and inconsistencies in financial tables, nothing else matters.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 — Frontend Dashboard

## Current Position

Phase: 6.1 of 7 (Bidirectional Verification + Deep Research)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Completed
Last activity: 2026-01-21 - Completed Phase 6.1 (all plans)

Progress: ████████████████ 100%


## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 19
- Average duration: 10.5m
- Total execution time: 3.40 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 3 | 3 | 15m |
| 02-document-ingestion | 2 | 2 | 12m |
| 03-numeric-validation | 3 | 3 | 7m |
| 3.1-root-orchestrator-agent | 1 | 1 | 15m |
| 04-logic-consistency | 1 | 1 | 3m |
| 4.1-logic-reviewer | 1 | 1 | 3m |
| 05-disclosure-compliance | 1 | 1 | 38m |
| 5.1-disclosure-reviewer | 1 | 1 | 2m |
| 06-external-signal | 1 | 1 | 18m |
| 6.1-bidirectional-verification-deep-research-integration | 2 | 2 | 2m |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 07-02, 07-03, 07-04, 6.1-01, 6.1-02
- Trend: Fast execution on well-researched tasks (6.1-01, 6.1-02 - 2m each), UI tasks (07-* - 2-5m), moderate integration tasks (06-01 - 18m), complex features (05-01 - 38m)
